# Create a Cybersecurity Portfolio  
_Notes by Abhishek (EzAbyss)_

## 🌟 Overview

A cybersecurity portfolio is a **professional collection of your work** that demonstrates your:
- Skills
- Knowledge
- Learning progress
- Passion for cybersecurity

Unlike a resume, which is short and summarized, a portfolio provides **depth and evidence** of what you can do.

Throughout the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, you will gradually build items that can be included in your portfolio.

## 🎯 Why a Cybersecurity Portfolio Is Important

Cybersecurity professionals use portfolios to:

- Show practical understanding of security concepts  
- Demonstrate problem-solving and documentation skills  
- Stand out from other candidates  
- Prove motivation and consistency  

A portfolio answers the employer’s question:
> “Can this person actually do the work?”

## 📄 Resume vs Portfolio (Memory Tip)

| Resume | Portfolio |
|------|-----------|
| 1–2 pages | Multiple documents |
| Summary | Detailed evidence |
| Lists skills | Shows skills in action |
| Static | Continuously evolving |

👉 **Resume = overview**  
👉 **Portfolio = proof**
