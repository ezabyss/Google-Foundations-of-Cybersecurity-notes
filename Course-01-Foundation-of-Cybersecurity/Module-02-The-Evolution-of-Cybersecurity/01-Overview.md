## 1. Introduction
Cybersecurity continues to evolve, but many modern attacks are improved versions of older ones. Understanding the history of cybersecurity helps analysts recognize patterns, protect systems, and respond effectively to incidents.

These notes cover:
- Early malware & internet-era attacks  
- Social engineering evolution  
- Key lessons for future analysts

## 2. Key Terms

### **Computer Virus**
Malicious code that attaches to programs or files, spreads between computers, and disrupts operations.

### **Malware**
A broader term for any software designed to harm devices, networks, or data.

## 3. Early Cyber Attacks

---

### **3.1 The Brain Virus (1981986)**  
**Creators:** Alvi brothers  
**Purpose:** Track illegal copies of their medical software  

#### **How It Spread**
- Infected computers that used pirated software  
- Any disk inserted into those computers also became infected  
- Spread globally within months  

#### **Impact**
- Slowed down computers and business operations  
- Did not destroy data but affected productivity  
- Highlighted the importance of security planning  

#### **Key Lesson**
Even non-destructive malware can disrupt businesses. Security analysts must maintain strategies to protect data and ensure continuity.

### **3.2 The Morris Worm (1988)**  
**Creator:** Robert Morris  
**Purpose:** Estimate the size of the early internet  

#### **What Went Wrong**
- Worm reinstalled itself repeatedly  
- Machines ran out of memory and crashed  

#### **Impact**
- Affected **6,000 computers** (10% of the internet at the time)  
- Caused millions in damages  
- Led to the creation of **CERTs® (Computer Emergency Response Teams)**  

#### **Key Lesson**
Incident response must be organized and fast. CERTs remain core to cybersecurity operations today.

## 4. Digital Age Attacks

With global internet access, malware no longer needed physical disks. Two major attacks shaped modern cybersecurity awareness: **LoveLetter** and **Equifax**.

---

### **4.1 LoveLetter Malware (2000)**  
**Creator:** Onel De Guzman  
**Goal:** Steal internet login credentials  

#### **How It Worked**
- Email subject: **"I Love You"**  
- Attachment: **"Love Letter For You"**  
- Once opened:
  - Scanned victim’s address book  
  - Emailed itself to all contacts  
  - Installed password-stealing software  

#### **Impact**
- Infected **45+ million** computers  
- Caused over **$10 billion** in damages  
- First major global **social engineering attack**  

#### **Key Lesson**
Psychological manipulation is powerful. Users must be trained to identify phishing and suspicious emails.

---

### **4.2 Social Engineering**

#### **Definition**
Manipulating people into revealing sensitive information or granting access.

#### **Common Examples**
- Phishing  
- Fake login pages  
- Impersonation  
- Suspicious attachments  

#### **Why It’s Increasing**
- Social media makes personal data easier to access  
- Users prioritize convenience over privacy  

#### **Role of Security Analysts**
- Identify unsafe behaviors  
- Conduct awareness training  
- Protect the organization from human-based threats  

---

### **4.3 The Equifax Breach (2017)**  
**Target:** Equifax – U.S. credit reporting agency  
**Data Exposed:**  
- Social Security numbers  
- Birth dates  
- Driver’s license numbers  
- Home addresses  
- Credit card details  

#### **How the Breach Happened**
- Multiple known vulnerabilities were left unpatched  
- Weak internal processes allowed attackers prolonged access  

#### **Impact**
- **143 million** customer records stolen  
- Affected ~40% of Americans  
- Equifax paid **$575 million** in fines and settlements  

#### **Key Lesson**
Patch management is critical. Failure to fix vulnerabilities can result in massive financial and reputational damage.

## 5. Why These Incidents Matter

#### **For Cybersecurity Professionals:**
- Many modern attacks follow old patterns  
- Social engineering remains highly effective  
- Employee training is essential  
- Understanding history helps detect warning signs  
- Cybersecurity protects real people’s financial and personal lives
