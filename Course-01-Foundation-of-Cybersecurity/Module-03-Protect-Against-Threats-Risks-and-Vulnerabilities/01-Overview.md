# Module 3 - Protect Against Threats, Risks & Vulnerabilities.
_Notes by Abhishek (EzAbyss)_

---

This module focuses on **how organizations protect themselves** from:

- Threats  
- Risks  
- Vulnerabilities  

You’ll learn about:

- **Security frameworks**  
- **Security controls**  
- **Security ethics**  
- **The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**

## 🌿 2. The Garden Analogy (Easiest Way to Understand Security)

Imagine you want to **grow a garden**:

### 🧠 Step 1: Plan & Prepare  
- You research what you need  
- You gather tools, seeds, soil  
- You think about possible risks (weeds, pests, weather)

➡️ This is like an organization identifying **threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**.

---

### 🌧️ Step 2: Unexpected Problems  
- Weather becomes unpredictable  
- Pests sneak in  
- Plants become exposed  

➡️ These represent **real cybersecurity incidents**.

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Improve Security  
You take action:

- Build a **fence** → physical control  
- Install a **camera** → monitoring control  
- Add a **canopy** → protective control  

➡️ Same way, organizations implement **security controls** to protect systems.

---

### 🔄 Step 4: Continuous Monitoring  
You create routines:

- Water regularly  
- Pull weeds  
- Inspect pests  
- Adjust protection as needed  

➡️ Just like security teams must **continuously monitor, update, and improve** policies and procedures.

---

## 🌻 3. Why This Analogy Matters  
Security is **never one-time** work.  
It is:

- **Evolving**  
- **Continuous**  
- **Adaptive**  

Just like maintaining a garden, analysts must always:

- Watch for new risks  
- Improve defenses  
- Update policies  
- Keep systems healthy

## 🧱 4. What You Will Learn in Module 3

### ✔️ **Security Frameworks**
Structured guides that organizations follow to stay secure.  
(Like a “garden blueprint” for security operations.)

### ✔️ **Security Controls**
Tools, processes, or rules that protect systems.  
Examples: firewalls, MFA, logging, encryption.

### ✔️ **CIA Triad**
The three core pillars of information security:

| CIA Component | Meaning | Simple Example |
|---------------|---------|----------------|
| **C – Confidentiality** | Only the right people can access data | Passwords, MFA |
| **I – Integrity** | Data must be accurate & unchanged | Hashing, version control |
| **A – Availability** | Systems must be accessible when needed | Backups, redundancy |

The CIA Triad helps guide all security decisions.

## 🔐 5. Everyday Example  
Security controls are not just for professionals — we use them daily:

- Using **security keys** as a second authentication method  
- Using **2FA codes**  
- Using **password managers**  
- Locking devices  
- Enabling **biometric authentication**

Security keys improve:

- **Confidentiality** → Only you can log in  
- **Integrity** → Accounts aren't tampered with  
- **Availability** → You always have secure access  

---

## ⚖️ 6. Ethics in Security  
Module 3 also introduces **ethical responsibilities** of cybersecurity professionals.

Ethical challenges may include:

- Handling user data responsibly  
- Reporting vulnerabilities honestly  
- Respecting privacy  
- Avoiding misuse of access  
- Preventing discrimination in AI-driven tools  

Ethics ensures trust, fairness, and safety in cybersecurity.

---

## ⭐ 7. Why Module 3 Matters (Key Takeaways)

- Security needs **constant improvements**  
- Frameworks help organizations stay consistent  
- Controls protect people, data, and systems  
- The CIA Triad shapes every security decision  
- Ethics guide professional behavior  
- Security is like a garden — **you must protect, monitor, and grow it continuously**

---

## 🎯 8. Memory Boost: The Garden Formula

**Plan ➝ Protect ➝ Improve ➝ Monitor**  
(Just like security lifecycle)
