# 🤝 Incident Response Teams & CSIRTs  
**Incident Response Operations**

---

## 1️⃣ Why Incident Response Is a Team Effort

Just like in sports, school, or the workplace, **teams succeed when individuals use their strengths toward a shared goal**.

Incident response is no different.

🚨 A successful response to a security incident:
- **Does not happen in isolation**
- Requires **coordination across roles**
- Depends on **clear responsibilities and communication**

Security incidents impact **technology, people, and the business**, so response must be collaborative.

## 2️⃣ What Is a CSIRT?

A **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)** is a specialized group of security professionals trained in:

- Incident detection
- Incident analysis
- Incident containment and recovery
- Post-incident improvement

### 🎯 Primary Goals of a CSIRT

- Manage incidents **effectively and efficiently**
- Provide services and resources for **response and recovery**
- Help **prevent future incidents** through lessons learned

📌 Security is a **shared responsibility**, so CSIRTs work cross-functionally with other departments.

---

## 3️⃣ Cross-Functional Collaboration (Why It Matters)

CSIRTs frequently collaborate with **non-security teams**, depending on the incident.

### Examples:

- **Legal team**
  - Required when incidents involve:
    - Personally identifiable information (PII)
    - Financial records
    - Regulatory obligations

- **Public relations (PR) team**
  - Some regulations require **public disclosure** within a specific timeframe
  - CSIRTs and PR must coordinate messaging to avoid:
    - Legal risk
    - Reputational damage
    - Misinformation

📌 Incident response is as much about **communication and compliance** as it is about technology.

## 4️⃣ Core Roles Within a CSIRT

---

### 🧠 Security Analyst

The **front line** of incident response.

Responsibilities:
- Investigate security alerts
- Determine whether an alert is an actual incident
- Assign a **criticality rating**
- Remediate low-impact incidents when possible

📌 Not all incidents require escalation.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Lead (Ops Lead)

Handles **highly critical incidents**.

Responsibilities:
- Provide technical leadership
- Guide incidents through the full lifecycle
- Make advanced response decisions
- Coordinate technical remediation

📌 This role may also be called:
- Ops Lead
- Incident Lead

---

### 🧭 Incident Coordinator

The **organizational backbone** of incident response.

Responsibilities:
- Track incident progress
- Coordinate CSIRT and external teams
- Ensure response procedures are followed
- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders

📌 This role ensures **nothing falls through the cracks**.

---

## 5️⃣ CSIRT Variations Across Organizations

Not all organizations use the same terminology or structure.

A CSIRT may also be called:
- **Incident Handling Team (IHT)**
- **Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)**

Some teams:
- Focus only on **crisis management**
- Are integrated with a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**
- Specialize in certain incident types

Regardless of structure or naming, the **mission remains the same**:
> Effective incident management and response.

---

## 6️⃣ How CSIRTs Fit Into the Bigger Picture

CSIRTs are responsible for:
- Detection and escalation
- Coordinated response
- Communication with stakeholders
- Supporting recovery
- Improving defenses after incidents

They operate within:
- Incident response plans
- Regulatory requirements
- Organizational risk tolerance

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Incident response is a **team-based activity**
- CSIRTs are specialized teams trained in incident management
- Security analysts, technical leads, and coordinators each play critical roles
- Cross-functional collaboration is essential
- Team names and structures vary, but goals stay the same
- Strong coordination leads to faster, safer incident resolution
