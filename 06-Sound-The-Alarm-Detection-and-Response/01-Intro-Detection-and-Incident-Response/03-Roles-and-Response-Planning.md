# 🧑‍🚒 Roles in Incident Response & Response Planning  
**Incident Response Operations | CSIRT & SOC Perspective**

---

## 1️⃣ Incident Response Lifecycle (Quick Recap)

Incident response activities are guided by the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**, which consists of four phases:

1. **Preparation**
2. **Detection and Analysis**
3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
4. **Post-Incident Activity**

As a security professional, you will **not work alone**. Incident response is inherently collaborative and depends on clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and communication paths.

---

## 2️⃣ Why Roles Matter in Incident Response

Understanding **who does what** during an incident helps you:

- Navigate organizational hierarchy
- Collaborate efficiently under pressure
- Escalate incidents correctly
- Respond faster and with fewer mistakes

It also helps you identify **career paths** you may want to pursue in security.

---

## 3️⃣ Command, Control, and Communication

Effective incident response relies on three core principles:

### 🧭 Command
- Clear leadership and decision-making authority
- Ensures the response stays focused and aligned with objectives

### 🛠️ Control
- Managing technical resources and response actions
- Assigning tasks and coordinating remediation efforts

### 📢 Communication
- Keeping stakeholders informed
- Ensuring accurate, timely updates internally and externally

📌 A well-defined **CSIRT structure** enables all three.

---

## 4️⃣ Roles in a CSIRT

A **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)** is a specialized group trained to manage incidents.  
CSIRTs vary by organization but typically involve both **security** and **nonsecurity** professionals.

### Nonsecurity roles (consulted as needed):
- Legal
- Human Resources
- Public Relations
- IT
- Management

### Core security roles in a CSIRT:

---

### 🧠 Security Analyst

The **first line of defense**.

Responsibilities:
- Monitor environments for threats
- Analyze and triage alerts
- Perform root-cause investigations
- Resolve low-impact incidents
- Escalate critical incidents to leads

📌 Analysts decide **whether an alert is an incident**.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Lead

Owns the **technical response strategy**.

Responsibilities:
- Determine root cause
- Design containment, eradication, and recovery actions
- Apply patches, updates, or configuration changes
- Coordinate with other technical teams
- Balance security actions with business priorities

📌 May also be called an **Ops Lead**.

---

### 🧭 Incident Coordinator

The **communication and coordination hub**.

Responsibilities:
- Coordinate with internal and external departments
- Track incident progress and timelines
- Ensure response processes are followed
- Provide regular status updates to stakeholders

📌 This role exists in both **CSIRTs and SOCs**.

---

### 🔎 Other Possible CSIRT Roles

Depending on the organization:
- Communications Lead
- Legal Lead
- Planning Lead
- Incident Commander / Incident Manager

⚠️ Titles and structures vary, but the **mission stays the same**.

---

## 5️⃣ Security Operations Center (SOC)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a dedicated unit responsible for:

- Monitoring networks, systems, and devices
- Detecting security threats
- Responding to incidents

SOCs are part of the **blue team**, focused on defense.

A SOC may:
- Exist independently
- Operate within a CSIRT

---

## 6️⃣ SOC Organizational Structure (Tiered Model)

### 🟢 Tier 1 – SOC Analyst (L1)

Entry-level analysts.

Responsibilities:
- Monitor and review alerts
- Prioritize alerts by severity
- Create and close tickets
- Escalate alerts to higher tiers

---

### 🟡 Tier 2 – SOC Analyst (L2)

More experienced analysts.

Responsibilities:
- Perform deeper investigations
- Analyze escalated tickets
- Tune and configure security tools
- Support detection improvements
- Report to SOC leads

---

### 🔴 Tier 3 – SOC Lead (L3)

Highly experienced analysts.

Responsibilities:
- Lead SOC operations
- Perform advanced detection
- Conduct malware and forensic analysis
- Improve detection logic
- Report to SOC manager

---

### 🧠 SOC Manager

Leadership and strategy role.

Responsibilities:
- Hire, train, and evaluate staff
- Define performance metrics
- Manage SOC effectiveness
- Produce reports for executives
- Support compliance and audits

---

### 🔬 Specialized SOC Roles

- **Forensic investigators**
  - Collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence

- **Threat hunters**
  - Proactively search for advanced or hidden threats
  - Use threat intelligence and behavioral analysis

📌 These roles are often filled by L2s and L3s.

---

## 7️⃣ Incident Response Plans (IRPs)

When incidents occur, teams must respond **quickly, consistently, and effectively**.

An **incident response plan (IRP)** is a formal document that defines:
- How incidents are handled
- Who is responsible
- What steps to follow at each phase

---

## 8️⃣ What an Incident Response Plan Contains

Although plans vary by organization, most include:

### 📘 Incident Response Procedures
- Step-by-step instructions for handling incidents

### 🗂️ System Information
- Network diagrams
- Data flow diagrams
- Logging sources
- Asset inventories

### 📞 Supporting Documents
- Contact lists
- Forms
- Templates
- Escalation paths

📌 Plans are tailored to:
- Organization size
- Industry
- Mission
- Culture
- Regulatory requirements

---

## 9️⃣ Testing & Improving Incident Response Plans

Incident response plans are **never perfect**.

They must be:
- Regularly reviewed
- Tested through exercises

### Common testing methods:
- Tabletop exercises
- Simulations
- Regulatory-mandated drills

🎯 These exercises:
- Ensure team familiarity
- Reveal gaps in procedures
- Improve response readiness

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Incident response relies on clearly defined roles
- CSIRTs coordinate technical and nontechnical efforts
- SOCs provide continuous monitoring and detection
- Tiered SOC models support scalable response
- Incident response plans ensure consistency
- Regular testing strengthens preparedness
- Knowing roles helps you respond smarter and faster
