# 🧪 Analyze Your First Packet — Wireshark Lab

## 📘 Introduction
This lab focuses on **basic packet analysis** using Wireshark.  
The goal is to understand how network packets are structured, viewed, and filtered inside a packet capture file.

Packet analysis is a **core foundational skill** for:
- Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts
- Network troubleshooting
- Incident response and digital forensics

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, I'll be able to:
- Open a packet capture (`.pcap`) file in Wireshark
- Identify packet source, destination, and protocol information
- Inspect packet details across protocol layers
- Apply display filters to isolate specific traffic

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- **Wireshark**
- **Windows Virtual Machine**
- **Packet Capture File (.pcap)**

---

## 🧪 Lab Activity
**Activity Name:** Analyze Your First Packet  
**Focus:** Packet inspection and filtering  
**Skill Level:** Beginner → SOC foundation  

---

## 📸 Evidence
The `evidence/` folder contains screenshots showing:
- Opened packet capture file in Wireshark
- Packet list and protocol details
- Applied display filters

---

## 🧠 Why This Lab Matters
Packet captures provide **direct visibility** into network activity.  
Instead of relying on assumptions or logs alone, packet analysis allows analysts to **see exactly what happened on the wire**.

This lab builds the groundwork for:
- Advanced traffic analysis
- Detection of suspicious activity
- Understanding real-world network behavior
