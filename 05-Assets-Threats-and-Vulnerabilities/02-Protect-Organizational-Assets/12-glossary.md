## Algorithm
A set of rules used to solve a problem.

## Application Programming Interface (API) token
A small block of encrypted code that contains information about a user.

## Asymmetric encryption
The use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data.

## Basic authentication (Basic Auth)
The technology used to establish a user’s request to access a server.

## Bit
The smallest unit of data measurement on a computer.

## Brute force attack
The trial-and-error process of discovering private information.

## Cipher
An algorithm that encrypts information.

## Cryptographic key
A mechanism that decrypts ciphertext.

## Cryptography
The process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can’t understand.

## Data custodian
Anyone or anything responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information.

## Data owner
The person who decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information.

## Digital certificate
A file that verifies the identity of a public key holder.

## Encryption
The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.

## Hash collision
An instance when different inputs produce the same hash value.

## Hash function
An algorithm that produces a code that can’t be decrypted.

## Hash table
A data structure used to store and reference hash values.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)
A collection of processes and technologies that helps organizations manage digital identities in their environment.

## Information privacy
The protection from unauthorized access and distribution of data.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
A security measure that requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

## Non-repudiation
The concept that the authenticity of information can’t be denied.

## OAuth
An open-standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications.

## Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)
A set of security standards formed by major organizations in the financial industry to protect payment card data.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Any information used to infer an individual’s identity.

## Rainbow table
A file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext.

An additional safeguard used to strengthen hash functions by adding random data before hashing.

## Security assessment
A check to determine how resilient current security implementations are against threats.

## Security audit
A review of an organization’s security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

## Security controls
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

## Separation of duties
The principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system.

## Session
A sequence of network HTTP basic authentication requests and responses associated with the same user.

## Session cookie
A token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session should last.

## Session hijacking
An event when attackers obtain a legitimate user’s session ID.

## Session ID
A unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing a system.

The use of a single secret key to exchange information.

## User provisioning
The process of creating and maintaining a user’s digital identity.
