# Linux Cryptography Lab – Caesar Cipher & File Decryption

## Overview
This project demonstrates practical cryptography skills using Linux command-line tools. The objective was to break a Caesar cipher, locate hidden files, and decrypt encrypted data using OpenSSL. The lab reinforces how encryption and decryption protect data confidentiality and how analysts can recover data when authorized.

## Scenario
All files in a Linux home directory were encrypted. As a security analyst, I explored the file system, identified hidden files, decrypted a Caesar cipher to obtain recovery instructions, and used a secure symmetric encryption algorithm (AES-256-CBC) to decrypt protected data.

## Objectives
- Navigate a Linux file system using Bash
- Identify and read hidden files
- Decrypt a Caesar cipher using character translation
- Decrypt an encrypted file using OpenSSL
- Understand the role of encryption in data security

## Skills Demonstrated
- Linux command-line navigation
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Caesar cipher decryption
- OpenSSL file decryption
- Secure handling of encrypted data
