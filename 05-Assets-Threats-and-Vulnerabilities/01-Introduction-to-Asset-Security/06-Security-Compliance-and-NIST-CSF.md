# 📜 Security Compliance & NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)  
*From Security Plans to Real-World Enforcement (with SOC Scenarios)*

---

## 🌍 Big Picture: Planning vs Reality
> **A security plan only works if people actually follow it.**

Having a plan is just the beginning.  
Ensuring that everyone follows that plan is called **compliance**.

---

## ✅ What Is Compliance?
**Compliance** is the process of:
- Adhering to **internal standards**
- Following **external regulations**

In simple terms:
> Compliance measures how well an organization protects its assets.

---

## 🎯 Why Compliance Is a Top Priority
Organizations focus on compliance to protect:
- Trust
- Reputation
- Safety
- Data integrity

Failure can lead to:
- Fines
- Penalties
- Lawsuits
- Long-term reputational damage

---

## 🏥 Highly Regulated Industries
Compliance is especially critical in:
- **Healthcare**
- **Energy**
- **Finance**

> In these industries, non-compliance can threaten business survival.

---

## 🧠 SOC Scenario: Compliance Failure
**Situation:**  
A healthcare company stores patient records without required safeguards.

**Impact:**
- Regulatory violation
- Heavy financial penalties
- Loss of customer trust

**SOC Role:**
- Detect violations
- Assist audits
- Support incident response

---

## ⚖️ Regulations vs Policies
**Regulations**:
- Are rules set by governments or authorities
- Must be followed

**Policies**:
- Are internal organizational rules
- Support regulatory compliance

> Regulations protect people and information on a **large scale**.

---

## 🌐 Why Compliance Is Complex
- Different laws in different countries
- Multiple regulations apply at once
- Assets often cross geographic borders

---

## 🧩 Introducing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is:
- A **voluntary** framework
- Based in the United States
- Designed to manage cybersecurity risk

It helps organizations protect one of their most valuable assets:
> **Information**

---

## 🧱 Components of the NIST CSF
The CSF has **three main components**:
1. **Core**
2. **Tiers**
3. **Profiles**

Each answers a different security question.

---

# 1️⃣ CSF Core — *What Security Does*

## 📌 Definition
The **CSF Core** defines desired cybersecurity outcomes.  
It acts as a **security checklist**.

---

## 🔁 CSF Core Functions (Updated)
The Core consists of **six functions**:

1. **Identify**
2. **Protect**
3. **Detect**
4. **Respond**
5. **Recover**
6. **Govern** *(added in 2024)*

---

## 🔍 Identify
Focus:
- Asset management
- Risk assessment
- Governance awareness

📌 *Know what you have and what could go wrong.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
SOC receives an alert but cannot determine severity.

**Root cause:**  
Asset not inventoried.

> Unknown assets = unknown risk.

---

## 🛡️ Protect
Focus:
- Access control
- Training
- Safeguards

📌 *Prevent incidents before they occur.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
Employee clicks phishing link, but:
- MFA blocks access
- Damage prevented

---

## 👀 Detect
Focus:
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Alerts

📌 *Find incidents quickly.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
SOC detects abnormal login attempts at midnight.

**Action:**  
Alert escalated immediately.

---

## 🚨 Respond
Focus:
- Incident response
- Containment
- Communication

📌 *Limit the impact.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
Confirmed breach detected.

SOC actions:
1. Isolate systems
2. Notify stakeholders
3. Preserve evidence

---

## 🔄 Recover
Focus:
- Restoring systems
- Improving resilience

📌 *Return to normal operations.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
Systems restored from clean backups after ransomware attack.

---

## 🏛️ Govern (New Function – 2024)
Focus:
- Leadership
- Policy decisions
- Risk oversight

📌 *Ensures accountability and direction.*

### 🧠 SOC Scenario
Leadership mandates improved detection after repeated incidents.

---

# 2️⃣ CSF Tiers — *How Well Security Is Done*

## 📌 Definition
**Tiers** measure the sophistication of an organization’s cybersecurity program.

---

## 🔢 Tier Levels

| Tier | Name | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| 1 | Passive | Minimal controls |
| 2 | Risk-Informed | Some awareness |
| 3 | Repeatable | Consistent processes |
| 4 | Adaptive | Continuous improvement |

> Tiers are **not yes/no** — they show progress and gaps.

---

## 🧠 SOC Insight
SOC teams often operate at:
- Tier 2–3 in smaller organizations
- Tier 4 in mature environments

---

# 3️⃣ CSF Profiles — *Where Security Stands*

## 📌 Definition
**Profiles** represent the current or desired cybersecurity posture.

---

## 📸 Photo Analogy
Profiles are like **snapshots in time**.

Comparing profiles shows:
- Improvement
- Weaknesses
- Progress toward goals

---

## 🧠 SOC Scenario
Current profile shows:
- Strong detection
- Weak recovery planning

**Action:**  
Invest in backups and recovery procedures.

---

# 🧩 Implementing the CSF in Real Organizations

## 📌 Framework vs Regulation
- **Regulations** → must follow
- **Frameworks** → choose to use

Organizations often use the CSF to:
- Support compliance
- Improve security posture

---

## 🛠️ Common CSF Implementation Steps (CISA Guidance)

1. Create a **current profile**
2. Perform a **risk assessment**
3. Identify and prioritize **security gaps**
4. Implement an **action plan**

> 💡 Always consider current threat and vulnerability trends.

---

## 🌍 Industries Using the CSF
The CSF:
- Aligns with global security practices
- Helps partners meet shared compliance requirements
- Is used across public and private sectors

---

## 🎯 Why Compliance Is More Than Avoiding Fines
Good security practice:
- Protects people
- Protects information
- Builds trust
- Strengthens security culture

> Compliance shows that an organization **cares**.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways 

- Compliance ensures security plans are followed
- Regulations are mandatory; frameworks are optional
- NIST CSF is flexible and widely adopted
- CSF Core defines security functions
- Tiers measure maturity
- Profiles show progress
- SOC teams operate across all CSF functions
