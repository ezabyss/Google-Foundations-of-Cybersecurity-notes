# 🛡️ Security Risk Planning: Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## 🌱 Introduction
Painting a portrait. Perfecting a new basketball move. Playing a solo on guitar.  
They all share one thing in common: **practice**.

Security works the same way. As you grow into the role of a security analyst, planning for the future becomes a skill you continuously develop. Every investigation, alert, and decision helps sharpen your ability to think ahead and reduce uncertainty before problems occur.

## 🧠 Why Risk Planning Matters
Think about how you prepare for a trip. You consider the weather, the length of the journey, and what might go wrong. Organizations approach security in a similar way—by **planning for risk**.

Security teams exist to help organizations protect what matters most by identifying and reducing risks that could affect systems, data, and people.

In cybersecurity, **risk** is anything that can impact:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

These three principles form the **CIA Triad**, which you’ll see referenced throughout your security career.

## 🔺 The CIA Triad
As a security professional, your work will always connect back to these goals:

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring information is accessed only by authorized users  
- **Integrity** – Ensuring data remains accurate and trustworthy  
- **Availability** – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed  

Security risk planning is often the first step organizations take to protect these core principles.

## 🧩 Core Elements of Security Planning
Every security plan is built around three fundamental elements. You’ll encounter these terms constantly, so understanding how they fit together is essential:

1. **Assets** – What the organization values and wants to protect  
2. **Threats** – What could cause harm to those assets  
3. **Vulnerabilities** – Weaknesses that make harm more likely  

Together, these elements explain the **what**, **why**, and **how** of security.

---

## 🏢 Assets
An **asset** is anything an organization considers valuable.

Common examples include:
- Buildings and facilities
- Computers, servers, and mobile devices
- Data and information
- Employees and customers

### 🏠 Home Analogy
Imagine your own home:
- People and personal belongings are assets
- Doors, windows, walls, and roofs are also assets
- Not all assets are protected equally

You probably care more about securing the front door than a wall, because it’s more likely to be targeted. Security teams make similar decisions when prioritizing protection.

---

## ⚠️ Threats
A **threat** is any event or circumstance that could negatively impact an asset.

### Examples of Threats
- A burglar attempting to enter a home
- Strong winds damaging doors or windows
- Accidental damage caused by everyday activities

When you naturally think through these possibilities, you’re already developing a **security mindset**.

---

## 🧨 Vulnerabilities
A **vulnerability** is a weakness that a threat can exploit.

Examples include:
- A weak lock on a door
- Cracked or aging building materials
- Misconfigured software
- Poor access control policies

You can think of vulnerabilities as **flaws within assets** that increase the chance of damage or compromise.

---

## 📐 Understanding Security Risk
Organizations often estimate risk using a simple concept:
    Likelihood × Impact = Risk


### 🚗 Real-World Example
- **Threat**: A nail on the road  
- **Vulnerability**: Tires can be punctured  
- **Impact**: Being late to work or facing consequences  

In cybersecurity, the same logic applies—only the assets and threats change.

---

## 🎯 Why We Calculate Risk
As a security analyst, risk calculations help you and your team:
- Prevent costly and disruptive incidents
- Identify improvements in systems and processes
- Decide which risks can be accepted
- Focus attention on the most critical assets

Your role often focuses on reducing **likelihood** by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

---

## 🔍 Risk Factors
Two major factors influence risk:

### **Threats**
Events or actions that could cause harm

### **Vulnerabilities**
Weaknesses that allow threats to succeed

>Risk increases when threats successfully exploit vulnerabilities.

---

## 🧨 Categories of Threats
Threats generally fall into two categories:

### **Intentional Threats**
- Malicious hackers
- Insider threats
- Social engineering attacks

### **Unintentional Threats**
- Human error
- Accidental damage
- Environmental or weather events

>Both types can lead to serious security incidents.

---

## 🧩 Categories of Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities also fall into two broad categories:

### **Technical Vulnerabilities**
- Unpatched systems
- Misconfigured software
- Weak encryption

### **Human Vulnerabilities**
- Lost access badges
- Weak passwords
- Lack of security awareness

>In real-world security work, you’ll often deal with both at the same time.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- **Risk**, **threat**, and **vulnerability** have specific meanings in cybersecurity
- Risk exists when threats exploit vulnerabilities
- Clear understanding builds credibility with teammates and stakeholders
