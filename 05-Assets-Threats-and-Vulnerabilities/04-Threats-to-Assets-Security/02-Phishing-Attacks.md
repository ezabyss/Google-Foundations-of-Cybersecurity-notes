## 🌍 Why Phishing Is So Effective

Cybercriminals prefer attacks that cause **maximum damage with minimal effort**. Phishing fits this goal perfectly.

**Phishing** is the use of **digital communications** to trick people into:

* Revealing sensitive information
* Installing malicious software

Although phishing can occur through many channels, it is **most commonly delivered via email**.

> 🧠 One compromised employee account can give attackers access to entire systems.

## 🧰 Phishing Kits: Tools Behind the Attack

Many phishing attacks are powered by **phishing kits**—prepackaged collections of tools that allow even non-technical criminals to launch campaigns.

### Core Components of a Phishing Kit

#### 📎 Malicious Attachments

* Infected files (PDFs, Word docs, ZIPs)
* Can install malware or ransomware

#### 📝 Fake Data-Collection Forms

* Disguised as surveys or account-verification forms
* Request sensitive data that should never be shared via email

#### 🔗 Fraudulent Web Links

* Lead to fake websites mimicking trusted brands
* Designed to steal login credentials
