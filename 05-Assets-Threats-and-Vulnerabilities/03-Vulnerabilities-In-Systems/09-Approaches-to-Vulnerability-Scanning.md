# 🔎 Approaches to Vulnerability Scanning

---

## 🌍 Why Vulnerability Scanning Matters

Vulnerability scanning is a **core technique** used during vulnerability assessments to proactively identify weaknesses before attackers do.

Scanning tools:

* Simulate attacker pathways
* Identify misconfigurations and flaws
* Support remediation planning

> 🧠 Scanning turns unknown weaknesses into actionable findings.

---

## 🧰 What Is a Vulnerability Scanner?

A **vulnerability scanner** is software that:

* Compares systems against **known vulnerabilities and exposures**
* Analyzes technologies across an organization’s attack surface
* Flags potential weaknesses for review

Scanners typically detect:

* Misconfigurations
* Missing patches
* Programming flaws

---

## 🎯 Attack Surfaces Scanned (Defense in Depth)

Vulnerability scanners analyze all **five attack surfaces**:

1️⃣ **Perimeter Layer** – Authentication systems and external access points

2️⃣ **Network Layer** – Firewalls, routers, and network services

3️⃣ **Endpoint Layer** – Laptops, desktops, and servers

4️⃣ **Application Layer** – Software users interact with

5️⃣ **Data Layer** – Data at rest, in transit, and in use

When scanning begins, findings are compared against **vulnerability databases**, which are continuously updated by scanner vendors.

## ⚙️ How Vulnerability Scans Work

* Scans are designed to be **non-intrusive**
* They do not exploit systems like real attackers
* They identify potential "unlocked doors"

> ⚠️ Note: In rare cases, scans can unintentionally disrupt systems (e.g., crashes).

## 🔄 Common Vulnerability Scanning Approaches

Different scan types simulate **different attacker perspectives**.

---

## 🌐 External vs Internal Scans

### 🌍 External Scans

**Purpose:** Simulate attacks from outside the organization

* Test perimeter defenses
* Analyze public-facing systems (websites, servers, firewalls)

**Common Findings:**

* Open ports
* Exposed services

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* External scan detects open port on web server
* SOC confirms unnecessary service exposed
* Port closed and firewall updated

➡️ **SOC Role:** Reduce external attack surface

---

### 🏢 Internal Scans

**Purpose:** Simulate insider or post-breach attacks

* Examine internal systems
* Analyze applications and internal configurations

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Internal scan reveals weak input validation
* SOC escalates to application team
* Code updated to prevent exploitation

➡️ **SOC Role:** Limit internal threat impact

---

## 🔐 Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans

---

### 🔑 Authenticated Scans

**Purpose:** Scan systems using valid credentials

* Uses user or admin accounts
* Detects issues like broken access controls

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Authenticated scan logs in as service account
* Finds excessive user privileges
* Access reduced to least privilege

➡️ **SOC Role:** Enforce proper authorization

---

### 🚫 Unauthenticated Scans

**Purpose:** Simulate attackers with no access

* Tests what outsiders can see
* Identifies exposed internal resources

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Unauthenticated scan accesses internal file share
* SOC flags critical exposure
* Permissions corrected immediately

➡️ **SOC Role:** Prevent unauthorized access

---

## 🎯 Limited vs Comprehensive Scans

---

### 🎯 Limited Scans

**Purpose:** Focus on specific systems or devices

* Example: Firewall or single server scan
* Faster and targeted

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Limited scan targets firewall rules
* Misconfiguration found
* Rule corrected

➡️ **SOC Role:** Quickly fix focused issues

---

### 🌐 Comprehensive Scans

**Purpose:** Scan the entire network

* Includes all devices, OS, applications, and databases
* Provides full security posture

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Comprehensive scan reveals multiple outdated systems
* SOC prioritizes remediation based on risk

➡️ **SOC Role:** Build organization-wide risk profile

---

## 🔍 Discovery Scanning (Pro Tip)

**Discovery scans** should be performed first to:

* Identify devices on the network
* Detect open ports and services

> 🧠 Discovery scanning sets the foundation for accurate vulnerability scanning.

---

## 📌 Role of Security Analysts

Although experienced professionals often configure scans, analysts:

* Review results
* Validate findings
* Support remediation
* Track compliance improvements

Scan results often lead to:

* Policy updates
* Compliance actions
* System patching

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Vulnerability scanners simulate attacker behavior
* Scans are non-intrusive but powerful
* Multiple scan types cover different attack paths
* Discovery scans come first
* Analysts play a key role in interpreting results
