## 🌩️ Understanding Cybersecurity Through a Storm Analogy

Imagine preparing for a major storm.  
You receive a warning, so you begin gathering the materials and tools needed to stay safe.  
You secure your windows and doors, assemble a first aid kit, stock up on food and water, and get ready.

When the storm finally arrives—with powerful winds and heavy rain—it tests your preparations.  
Water begins to leak in certain places, and you quickly patch these areas to prevent further damage.

➡️ **Handling a cybersecurity incident works the exact same way.**

Organizations must:

- Prepare for threats in advance  
- Gather the right tools  
- Build strong defenses  
- Respond quickly when something breaks through  

As a **security analyst**, your mission is to protect your organization—and the people it serves—from risks and attacks.  
If a threat manages to get inside, your job is to **contain it, fix it, and minimize damage.**

## 🔐 What Is Cybersecurity?

**Cybersecurity** (or simply *security*) is the practice of ensuring:

- **Confidentiality** → Only authorized people can access information  
- **Integrity** → Data stays accurate and trustworthy  
- **Availability** → Systems and information are accessible when needed  

This is accomplished by protecting:

- Networks  
- Devices  
- Data  
- People  

from **unauthorized access, misuse, or criminal exploitation**.

📌 *Example:*  
Requiring strong, complex passwords helps maintain **confidentiality**, making it harder for a threat actor to break in.

## 🎭 Threat Actors

A **threat actor** is *any* person or group that poses a security risk.

### External Threat  
Someone *outside* the organization attempting to gain unauthorized access.

### Internal Threat  
A threat originating from:

- employees  
- ex-employees  
- contractors  
- partners  

Internal threats can be:

- **Accidental** (like clicking a malicious email)
- **Intentional** (like abusing systems or accessing data without permission)

Security professionals help organizations **reduce, prevent, and respond** to these threats.

## ⚖️ Security & Compliance

Security teams also help ensure organizations follow:

- **Laws**
- **Industry standards**
- **Regulations**

This is called **regulatory compliance**.

Staying compliant helps organizations:

- Avoid legal penalties  
- Avoid expensive audits  
- Maintain ethical responsibility to protect user data

## 🏢 Security’s Impact on Business

Strong security supports business goals:

### ✔️ Business continuity  
Security teams plan for emergencies so employees can continue working even after incidents like breaches.

### ✔️ Reducing expenses  
Good security reduces costs related to:

- Data recovery  
- Operational downtime  
- Regulatory fines  

### ✔️ Maintaining brand trust  
A single breach can:

- Damage reputation  
- Reduce customer trust  
- Lead to long-term financial loss  

Security ensures the business remains trustworthy and reliable.
