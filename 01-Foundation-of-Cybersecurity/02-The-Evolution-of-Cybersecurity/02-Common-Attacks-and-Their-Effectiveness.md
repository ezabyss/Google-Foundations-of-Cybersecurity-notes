Earlier, Historic attacks like the Morris Worm and the LoveLetter virus. These incidents helped lead to the development of Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs).  

Now, **common attack methods** and how understanding them helps security analysts prevent, detect, and respond to threats.

- **Viruses:**  
  Malicious code requiring user action to spread via attachments or downloads.

- **Worms:**  
  Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user action.

- **Ransomware:**  
  Attackers encrypt data and demand payment for restoration.

- **Spyware:**  
  Software used to secretly gather and sell sensitive information (emails, texts, recordings, location, etc.).

# **3. Social Engineering**

**Definition:**  
Manipulating human behavior to extract information, gain access, or obtain valuables.  
Humans are often the weakest link due to trust and emotional responses.
