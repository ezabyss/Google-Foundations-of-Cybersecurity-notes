_Notes by Abhishek (EzAbyss)_

## 🔐 1. Introduction

Security frameworks, controls, and compliance work together to help organizations:

- Reduce risk  
- Protect assets  
- Maintain legal & regulatory obligations  
- Ensure consistent security behavior  

A security lifecycle is a **continuous** set of evolving policies and standards that guide how organizations manage risk.

# 🧩 2. Relationship Between Controls, Frameworks & Compliance

### ⭐ CIA Triad = The Foundation  
The **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** triad guides how organizations think about risk.

- **Confidentiality** → Only authorized users access data  
- **Integrity** → Data is correct & unaltered  
- **Availability** → Data is accessible when needed  

Security teams apply CIA principles to choose the **right controls** for the **right risks**.

## 🔐 What Are Security Controls?

**Controls** = safeguards that reduce specific security risks.

Examples:

- Access controls  
- MFA  
- Encryption  
- Audit logs  
- Training requirements  

Controls enforce framework rules and help organizations meet compliance obligations.

---

## 🧱 What Are Security Frameworks?

**Frameworks** = structured guidelines for managing security programs.

They help organizations:

- Build plans  
- Identify risks  
- Protect data & privacy  
- Align with regulations  

### **The four core components of every framework:**
1. **Identify & document security goals**  
2. **Set guidelines** to achieve the goals  
3. **Implement strong processes**  
4. **Monitor & communicate results**

Framework example goals:  
- GDPR compliance  
- PCI DSS security requirements  
- HIPAA privacy protection

# 🏛️ 3. What is Compliance?

**Compliance** = following internal standards and external laws/regulations.

Compliance ensures:

- Legal protection  
- Reduced organizational risk  
- Accountability  
- Safe handling of sensitive data

# 🌐 4. Major Frameworks, Controls & Compliance Standards

Below are widely recognized standards every security analyst must know.

---

## 🇺🇸 **NIST Frameworks**

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** develops voluntary frameworks used globally.

### **NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)**
- Guides cybersecurity activities
- Helps manage short- and long-term risk  
- Common across industries

### **NIST RMF (Risk Management Framework)**
- Provides a structured method for assessing and managing risk  
- Often used in government or regulated industries

# ⚡ 5. Sector-Specific and Global Compliance Standards

## **FERC–NERC (Energy Sector Regulation)**
Applied to organizations working with the U.S./North American **power grid**.

Requirements:

- Prepare for security incidents  
- Report threats  
- Follow Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards  

Purpose:  
Protect national electricity infrastructure.

---

## ☁ **FedRAMP**
A U.S. federal program for cloud service providers.

It standardizes:

- Security assessment  
- Authorization  
- Continuous monitoring  

Goal: Consistent and secure cloud services used in government.

---

## 🔒 **CIS Controls**
Created by the Center for Internet Security (CIS).

Provides:

- Actionable security controls  
- Defense guidelines  
- Incident response recommendations  

Commonly used by businesses to strengthen their baseline security posture.

---

## 🇪🇺 **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
Applies to any organization processing data of **EU residents**.

Key requirements:

- Transparency about data usage  
- Right to access, modify, delete personal data  
- Breach notification within **72 hours**  
- Heavy fines for violations  

Protects privacy of EU citizens worldwide.

---

## 💳 **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**
Applies to businesses that store/process/handle **credit card data**.

Goal:

- Reduce credit card fraud  
- Ensure secure processing and transmission  

Includes requirements for encryption, monitoring, and access controls.

---

## 🏥 **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**  
U.S. law that protects patient health information (PHI).

Governed by three rules:

1. **Privacy Rule**  
2. **Security Rule**  
3. **Breach Notification Rule**

Organizations must:

- Protect PHI  
- Notify patients if their data is exposed  
- Prevent identity theft or insurance fraud  

### Related: **HITRUST Framework**  
Helps organizations meet HIPAA compliance.

---

## 🌎 **ISO Standards (International Organization for Standardization)**

ISO creates **global standards** for:

- Security  
- Technology  
- Manufacturing  
- Risk management  

Examples:  
ISO 27001 (information security management) is widely used for process improvement and compliance.

---

## 📄 **SOC 1 & SOC 2 Reports**
Developed by AICPA.

Evaluate:

- Security  
- Privacy  
- Integrity  
- Availability  
- Confidentiality  
- User access policies at all organizational levels  

Used to judge:

- Financial compliance  
- Risk exposure  
- Vendor trust  

Control failures can lead to fraud.

---

# 🔍 6. Stay Updated

Regulations often change. Analysts should stay informed about:

- **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)**  
- **Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX)**  

And evolving frameworks like:

- Zero Trust  
- NIST CSF 2.0  
- Updated CIS Controls  

Cybersecurity evolves constantly—so should your knowledge.

---

# ⭐ 7. Key Takeaways

- **Frameworks** = structured guidelines to manage risk  
- **Controls** = safeguards that reduce risk  
- **Compliance** = following laws & regulations  

Together, they:

- Keep organizations secure  
- Reduce financial/legal risk  
- Protect people and data  
- Support trustworthy systems  

As a security analyst, it's essential to:

- Understand common frameworks  
- Apply controls correctly  
- Stay updated on compliance changes  

This knowledge forms the foundation of cybersecurity work.
