## 🌟 Introduction

Cybersecurity professionals protect organizations by combining **technical skills**, **tools**, **operating systems**, and **programming languages**.  
These elements work together to help security analysts:

- Detect threats  
- Reduce risks  
- Investigate incidents  
- Protect sensitive data  
- Automate repetitive tasks  

Every organization chooses a different set of tools, but **industry-standard concepts remain the same**.

---

# 🧰 1. An Entry-Level Analyst’s Toolkit

As a future security analyst, it’s important to:

- Be familiar with **common cybersecurity tools**
- Understand their **purpose**
- Demonstrate the ability to **learn new tools quickly**

Tools may change, but strong fundamentals make you adaptable and valuable.

---

# 📄 2. Logs — The Foundation of Security Monitoring

A **log** is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems.

### Examples:
- User login attempts  
- File access events  
- Network connections  
- Application errors  

Logs are the **raw data** that security tools analyze to identify risks and threats.

---

# 📊 3. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## 🔹 What Is a SIEM?
A **SIEM tool** collects and analyzes log data from multiple sources to monitor critical activity.

### Why SIEM tools are important:
- Manual log review can take hours or days  
- SIEMs filter massive data volumes  
- Analysts receive alerts for real threats  

---

## 🔹 Key SIEM Features

- Centralized log collection  
- Real-time analysis  
- Threat and vulnerability alerts  
- Dashboards for investigation  
- Trend and pattern detection  

---

## 🔹 SIEM Dashboards & Hosting

### Dashboards:
- Visually organize data  
- Allow filtering and focused analysis  

### Hosting options:
- **On-premise** → more control, more expertise required  
- **Cloud-hosted** → easier to deploy and maintain  

Organizations choose based on skill level and security needs.

---

# 🌐 4. Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

A **network protocol analyzer**, or **packet sniffer**, captures and analyzes network traffic.

### Why they matter:
- Detect unauthorized data transfers  
- Identify malicious traffic  
- Investigate suspicious behavior  
- Understand how data moves through networks  

Hands-on practice will come later in the program.

---

# 📘 5. Playbooks

## 🔹 What Is a Playbook?
A **playbook** is a step-by-step guide for performing specific security tasks.

Playbooks ensure:
- Consistent responses  
- Proper procedures  
- Reduced errors  
- Compliance with policies  

---

## 🔍 6. Playbooks in Forensic Investigations

### Example:
You investigate a breach at a medical practice.  
Your findings help determine a cybersecurity insurance payout.

Playbooks guide **how evidence is collected, handled, and preserved**.

---

## 🧾 A. Chain of Custody Playbook

**Chain of custody** documents:
- Who handled the evidence  
- What the evidence is  
- Where it was stored  
- When it moved  
- Why it was accessed  

Purpose:
- Maintain evidence integrity  
- Prevent tampering  
- Support legal and insurance processes  

---

## 🧬 B. Protecting & Preserving Evidence Playbook

Digital evidence can be **fragile and volatile**.

### Order of Volatility:
A priority list for preserving data:
- Volatile data first (lost if power is off)  
- Less volatile data later  

Best practice:
- Preserve data immediately  
- Make copies  
- Investigate using copies, not originals  

Improper handling can make evidence unusable.

---

# 💻 7. Programming in Cybersecurity

## 🔹 What Is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

Security analysts use programming to enable **automation**.

### Automation helps:
- Reduce manual effort  
- Minimize human error  
- Increase accuracy  
- Save time  

---

## 🐍 Python

Python is used to:
- Automate repetitive security tasks  
- Analyze data  
- Process logs  
- Build scripts and workflows  

Python improves efficiency and consistency in security operations.

---

## 🗃️ SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is used to:
- Create and interact with databases  
- Retrieve specific data points  
- Filter millions of records  

Security analysts use SQL to:
- Investigate incidents  
- Identify trends  
- Extract meaningful insights  

---

# 🖥️ 8. Operating Systems

An **operating system (OS)** is the interface between hardware and the user.

Examples:
- Linux®  
- macOS®  
- Windows  

Each OS provides different capabilities and experiences.

---

## 🐧 Linux Operating System

Linux is:
- Open-source (publicly available code)
- Widely used in cybersecurity
- Command-line driven  

Linux is **not a programming language**, but uses **commands** to interact with the system.

Common security uses:
- Examining logs  
- Investigating errors  
- Monitoring system activity  

---

# 🌐 9. Web Vulnerabilities

A **web vulnerability** is a flaw in a web application that attackers can exploit to:
- Gain unauthorized access  
- Steal data  
- Deploy malware  

To stay updated on critical web risks, refer to:
- **OWASP Top 10**

---

# 🦠 10. Antivirus (Anti-Malware) Software

Antivirus software:
- Detects malware and viruses  
- Prevents infections  
- Removes malicious programs  

It may scan:
- Memory  
- Files  
- System behavior  

---

# 🚨 11. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

An **IDS** monitors system and network activity to detect intrusions.

IDS functions:
- Analyzes network packets  
- Detects unauthorized access  
- Identifies data theft and suspicious behavior  

Small packet sizes make threat detection easier.

---

# 🔐 12. Encryption

Encryption protects data by making it unreadable to unauthorized users.

### Key terms:
- **Plaintext** → readable data  
- **Ciphertext** → encrypted data  

Purpose:
- Ensure confidentiality  
- Protect sensitive information  

⚠️ Note:
- **Encryption ≠ Encoding**  
- Encoding helps systems share data  
- Encryption protects data from attackers  

---

# 🧪 13. Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)

Penetration testing is a **simulated attack** used to:
- Identify vulnerabilities  
- Assess security posture  
- Evaluate internal and external threats  

Pen testing helps organizations strengthen defenses **before real attacks happen**.

---

# 🧠 14. Big Picture: Why Tools Matter

- Every organization uses different tools  
- The more tools you understand, the more valuable you are  
- Tools help analysts work:
  - Faster  
  - Smarter  
  - More accurately  

Foundational knowledge allows you to adapt anywhere.
