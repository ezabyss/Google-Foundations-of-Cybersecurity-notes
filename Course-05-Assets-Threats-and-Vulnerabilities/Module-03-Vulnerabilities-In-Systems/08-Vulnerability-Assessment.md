# 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment Process

---

## 🌍 Purpose of Vulnerability Assessments

Vulnerabilities do not appear randomly — they are **discovered through structured reviews** called **vulnerability assessments**.

A **vulnerability assessment** is an **internal review process** used by organizations to:

* Identify weaknesses and flaws
* Prevent attacks before they occur
* Evaluate whether security controls meet regulatory standards

Unlike the CVE® process (global and public), vulnerability assessments are:

* Conducted internally
* Managed entirely by the organization’s security team

---

## 🧑‍💻 Role of Security Analysts

Security analysts are involved **throughout the entire assessment lifecycle**.

They:

* Run scans and tests
* Analyze findings
* Assess risk
* Coordinate remediation

> 🧠 The goal is not just to find vulnerabilities, but to **reduce real-world risk**.

---

## 🎯 Why Vulnerability Assessments Are Performed Frequently

Organizations perform vulnerability assessments regularly because:

* They have many assets to protect
* Systems and software constantly change
* New threats appear all the time

Since resources are limited, teams often **scope assessments** to focus on the most critical systems first.

---

## 🔁 The Four-Step Vulnerability Assessment Process

Once scope is defined, vulnerability assessments follow a **four-step cycle**.

---

## 1️⃣ Identification

### 🔍 What Happens in This Step

* Automated scanning tools are used
* Manual testing is performed
* The goal is to capture the **current security state**

This step often produces **a large number of findings**.

> 📸 Think of identification as taking a snapshot of the system.

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* SOC runs vulnerability scanner
* Hundreds of alerts detected
* Findings logged for analysis

➡️ **SOC Role:** Discover potential weaknesses

---

## 2️⃣ Vulnerability Analysis

### 🧠 What Happens in This Step

* Each identified vulnerability is examined
* Root causes are investigated
* False positives are filtered out

Security analysts act as **digital detectives**, asking:

* Why does this vulnerability exist?
* Where did it originate?

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* SOC investigates flagged vulnerability
* Determines misconfiguration is root cause
* Confirms issue is valid

➡️ **SOC Role:** Understand the source of the weakness

---

## 3️⃣ Risk Assessment

### 📊 What Happens in This Step

Each vulnerability is assigned a **risk score** based on:

1. **Impact** — How severe the damage would be
2. **Likelihood** — How likely exploitation is

Because vulnerabilities often outnumber staff, this step helps **prioritize work**.

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* High-impact vulnerability identified
* Exploit is actively used in the wild
* SOC assigns high risk score

➡️ **SOC Role:** Prioritize vulnerabilities strategically

---

## 4️⃣ Remediation

### 🛠️ What Happens in This Step

* Vulnerabilities are fixed or mitigated
* Actions depend on risk score

Remediation is usually a **joint effort** between:

* Security teams
* IT teams

### Common Remediation Actions

* Applying system patches
* Updating operating systems
* Enforcing new security procedures

### 🕵️ SOC Scenario

* Critical vulnerability patched
* Security policy updated
* System rescanned to confirm fix

➡️ **SOC Role:** Reduce risk through corrective action

---

## 🔄 Vulnerability Assessments Are Proactive

Vulnerability assessments allow organizations to:

* Find weaknesses **before attackers do**
* Reduce exposure to threats
* Improve overall security posture

> 🔁 They are repeated regularly as systems evolve.

---

## ❓ What Comes Next?

Vulnerability assessments reveal **what is wrong**, but another question remains:

> **Where should organizations look first?**

This leads into understanding **attack surfaces**, which will be explored next.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Vulnerability assessments are internal reviews
* Security analysts play a central role
* The process has four steps: Identification, Analysis, Risk Assessment, Remediation
* Risk scoring helps prioritize limited resources
* Assessments are proactive and recurring
