# 🔐 Security Controls 
*Protecting Information in a Connected World*

---

## 🌍 The Modern Security Challenge
Information today exists:
- On personal devices
- On company systems
- In the cloud
- Across global networks

As a result, organizations face **constant pressure** to protect data from:
- Theft
- Exposure
- Misuse

This is where **security controls** come in.

---

## 🛡️ What Are Security Controls?
**Security controls** are safeguards designed to:
- Reduce specific security risks
- Protect assets **before, during, and after** an event

They are the practical tools that turn security plans into action.

---

## 🧩 Three Types of Security Controls

Security controls fall into **three main categories**:

1. **Technical Controls**
2. **Operational Controls**
3. **Managerial Controls**

Each plays a unique role.

---

## 1️⃣ Technical Controls (Technology-Based)

### 📌 Definition
**Technical controls** use technology to protect assets.

### 📍 Examples
- Encryption
- Authentication systems
- Firewalls
- Access control systems

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Technical Control
**Situation:**  
SOC detects unauthorized login attempts.

**Control in Action:**  
- MFA blocks access
- Account locked automatically

**Result:**  
Threat stopped before data exposure.

---

## 2️⃣ Operational Controls (People & Processes)

### 📌 Definition
**Operational controls** maintain day-to-day security.

These controls are **performed by people**.

### 📍 Examples
- Security awareness training
- Incident response
- Change management

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Operational Control
**Situation:**  
Employee reports a phishing email.

**Control in Action:**  
- Incident response procedure followed
- Threat contained quickly

**Result:**  
Reduced impact due to human awareness.

---

## 3️⃣ Managerial Controls (Governance & Oversight)

### 📌 Definition
**Managerial controls** guide how security is implemented.

They focus on **risk reduction strategy**.

### 📍 Examples
- Policies
- Standards
- Procedures

> Security policies define which controls are required to meet organizational goals.

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Managerial Control
**Situation:**  
SOC enforces access restrictions based on policy.

**Outcome:**  
Clear accountability and consistent enforcement.

---

## 🔐 Information Privacy (Core Concept)

### 📌 Definition
**Information privacy** is the protection of data from:
- Unauthorized access
- Unauthorized distribution

Privacy is about **choice**.

> People and organizations have the right to decide **when, how, and to what extent** their information is shared.

---

## ✈️ Real-World Privacy Example
Booking a flight using a travel app requires:
- Name
- Email
- Credit card number

### Reasonable Expectation:
- Airline can access data to complete booking

### Unreasonable Access:
- Marketing team accessing credit card data

---

## 🧠 SOC Scenario: Privacy Violation
**Situation:**  
SOC detects employee accessing customer payment data without a business need.

**Impact:**  
- Privacy violation
- Compliance risk

**SOC Action:**  
- Investigate access logs
- Enforce access restrictions

---

## 🔑 Principle of Least Privilege (Very Important)

### 📌 Definition
The **principle of least privilege** means:
> Users should only have the **minimum access** required to do their job.

Access should be:
- Role-based
- Time-limited
- Situation-aware

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Least Privilege
**Situation:**  
Customer support agent accesses payment data outside active ticket.

**Finding:**  
Excessive permissions granted.

**Action:**  
- Reduce access scope
- Update access control policy

---

## 👤 Data Owners vs Data Custodians

### 🧠 Data Owner
A **data owner**:
- Decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy data
- Is responsible for data classification

📌 Example:
- Customer owns their personal information
- Organization may also be an owner of internal data

---

### 🧠 Data Custodian
A **data custodian**:
- Safely handles, stores, and transports data
- Can be a **person, system, or organization**

📌 Examples:
- Database server
- Cloud storage provider
- IT administrators

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Custodian Failure
**Situation:**  
Cloud storage bucket exposed due to misconfiguration.

**Issue:**  
Custodian failed to protect data properly.

**SOC Action:**  
- Secure storage
- Audit configurations
- Notify stakeholders

---

## 📦 Data as an Asset
Information is an asset.

Like all assets, it requires:
- Proper classification
- Secure handling
- Appropriate controls

Privacy protection depends on:
- Asset value
- Sensitivity
- Risk level

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways 

- Security controls reduce specific risks
- Controls fall into technical, operational, and managerial
- Information privacy protects choice and control
- Least privilege limits unnecessary access
- Data owners decide access
- Data custodians protect data
- SOC teams enforce and monitor controls daily
