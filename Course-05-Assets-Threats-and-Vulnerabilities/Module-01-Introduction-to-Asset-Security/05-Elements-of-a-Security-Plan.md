# 🛡️Elements of a Security Plans
> Security as a Culture: Policies, Standards & Procedures  
>*People • Processes • Technology *

---

## 🌍 The Big Idea of Security
> **Security is not just technology — it is people, processes, and culture.**

Protecting assets is a **team effort** that involves:
- Employees
- Vendors
- Customers
- Leadership
- Security teams (SOC, IT, Compliance)

Security succeeds when **everyone participates**.

---

## 🧠 Security = Culture
A **security culture** is a shared set of values that:
- Spans all levels of an organization
- Influences everyday decisions
- Reduces risk caused by human behavior

> 🔐 Most breaches involve **human error**, not technology failure.

---

## ⚠️ Understanding Risk
**Risk** is anything that can impact:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**  
of an asset (CIA Triad)

---

## 📦 Common Risk Categories
Security plans often group risks by outcome:

- **Damage** – physical destruction or malfunction
- **Disclosure** – unauthorized access or data leaks
- **Loss** – data deletion, theft, or unavailability

---

## 🧠 SOC Scenario: Human Error Risk
**Situation:**  
A new employee emails sensitive data using a personal email account.

**Risk Category:**  
- Disclosure of confidential information

**SOC Impact:**  
- Data exposure
- Possible compliance violation

**Prevention:**  
- Security awareness training
- Clear policies for acceptable use

---

## 📋 Why Security Plans Exist
Security plans exist to:
- Prepare for risks *before* they happen
- Align everyone with shared security values
- Reduce confusion during incidents

> Well-designed plans focus on **people first**.

---

## 🧩 The Three Elements of Every Security Plan

Security plans are communicated through:
1. **Policies**
2. **Standards**
3. **Procedures**

Although often confused, **each has a distinct role**.

---

## 1️⃣ Policies (Strategic Level)

### 📌 Definition
A **policy** is a set of rules that:
- Reduce risk
- Protect information
- Provide direction

Policies answer:
- **What are we protecting?**
- **Why are we protecting it?**

---

### 🧠 Key Characteristics of Policies
- High-level
- Mandatory
- Applies organization-wide
- Foundation of all security efforts

---

### 📍 Example: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
New employees must:
- Use corporate systems responsibly
- Avoid risky behavior (e.g., personal email for work data)

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Policy Violation
**Situation:**  
SOC detects repeated access to restricted systems from an unauthorized account.

**SOC Action:**  
- Check Acceptable Use Policy
- Escalate violation
- Notify HR and management

> Policies define **what is allowed and what is not**.

---

## 2️⃣ Standards (Tactical Level)

### 📌 Definition
**Standards** provide:
- Benchmarks
- Best practices
- Technical requirements

They explain **how policies should be implemented**.

---

### 🧠 How Standards Are Used
- Inform policy creation
- Ensure consistency
- Measure security effectiveness

---

### 📍 Example: Password Standards
A standard may require:
- Minimum password length
- Complexity rules
- MFA requirements

Many organizations reference:
- NIST password guidelines

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Weak Passwords
**Situation:**  
SOC investigates an account takeover caused by a weak password.

**Root Cause:**  
- Password standard not enforced

**SOC Outcome:**  
- Recommend updating standards
- Enforce technical controls

---

## 3️⃣ Procedures (Operational Level)

### 📌 Definition
**Procedures** are:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Task-specific
- Actionable

They explain **how to perform security tasks correctly**.

---

### 📍 Examples of Procedures
- How to create a secure password
- How to reset a locked account
- How to report a phishing email

---

### 🧠 SOC Scenario: Incident Response Procedure
**Situation:**  
SOC receives a phishing alert from an employee.

**Procedure Followed:**
1. Isolate affected account
2. Reset credentials
3. Scan for malicious activity
4. Document incident

> Procedures ensure **speed, consistency, and accuracy**.

---

## 🔁 How Policies, Standards & Procedures Work Together

| Element | Focus | Level |
|------|------|------|
| Policy | What & Why | Strategic |
| Standard | How well | Tactical |
| Procedure | How to | Operational |

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters to SOC Teams
SOC teams rely on:
- **Policies** to decide enforcement
- **Standards** to assess security posture
- **Procedures** to respond quickly

Without them:
- Incidents become chaotic
- Responses vary
- Accountability is lost

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Security is a shared responsibility
- Security plans focus on people, not just technology
- Risk impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability
- Policies define rules and intent
- Standards define benchmarks and best practices
- Procedures define step-by-step actions
- Clear plans reduce human error and response time
