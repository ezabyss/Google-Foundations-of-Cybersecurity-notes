# 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

**Notes by Abhishek (Ez Abyss)**

## 🌐 Purpose of Security Frameworks

Security frameworks are used by organizations as a **starting point** to develop plans that mitigate:

* Risks
* Threats
* Vulnerabilities

that affect **sensitive data and assets**.

Organizations worldwide rely on security frameworks to design effective security programs. These frameworks apply to:

* For-profit organizations
* Nonprofit organizations
* Government agencies

Although **NIST is a U.S.-based organization**, its guidance is used **globally** to implement essential cybersecurity practices.

---

## 🏗️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is one of the most widely used and respected security frameworks.

### Key Characteristics

* Voluntary framework
* Built on standards, guidelines, and best practices
* Designed to manage cybersecurity risk
* Applicable across industries and organization sizes

📌 *The CSF helps organizations build consistent and effective security programs.*

---

## 🔁 The Six Core Functions of NIST CSF

The latest version of the NIST CSF includes **six core functions**:

1. **Govern**
2. **Identify**
3. **Protect**
4. **Detect**
5. **Respond**
6. **Recover**

These functions guide how organizations establish oversight, prepare for incidents, respond to threats, and recover from security events.

---

## 🧠 New Core Function: Govern

### Purpose

The **Govern** function emphasizes strong cybersecurity governance across the organization.

### What Govern Focuses On

* Setting clear cybersecurity objectives
* Ensuring leadership commitment and accountability
* Defining roles, responsibilities, and decision-making structures
* Developing and maintaining a comprehensive risk management strategy
* Continuously improving cybersecurity performance

📌 *Govern ensures cybersecurity is a business and leadership responsibility, not just a technical one.*

## 🧑‍💼 Workplace Example: Applying the NIST CSF

### Scenario

A high-risk alert indicates that a workstation has been compromised.

### Step-by-Step Using the CSF

* **Govern**
  Security policies and risk management processes define how incidents are handled and who is accountable.

* **Identify**
  The compromised workstation is identified, and an unknown device is discovered.

* **Protect**
  The unknown device is blocked remotely to prevent further damage.

* **Detect**
  Security tools are used to look for additional threat actor activity and identify the device.

* **Respond**
  The incident is investigated to determine:

  * Who connected the device
  * How the threat occurred
  * What systems were affected
  * Where the attack originated

* **Recover**
  Affected files are restored, and damage to the workstation is corrected.

📌 *In this case, the incident was caused by an employee charging an infected phone through a work laptop.*

---

## 🎯 Why the NIST CSF Matters

The CSF:

* Provides clear guidance during incidents
* Helps security teams act quickly and effectively
* Reduces organizational risk
* Supports consistent incident handling

It is a **core framework** that most security professionals are expected to understand.

---

## 🏛️ NIST Special Publication 800-53 (SP 800-53)

The NIST CSF extends into federal government security through **NIST SP 800-53**.

### What SP 800-53 Does

* Provides a unified framework for protecting U.S. federal information systems
* Applies to government systems and private systems used by the government
* Defines security controls used to maintain the **CIA Triad**

📌 *Understanding SP 800-53 is essential for analysts interested in federal government roles.*

---

## 🔗 How Frameworks and Controls Work Together

* **Frameworks** provide structure and guidance
* **Controls** enforce security and reduce risk

Together, they help protect systems and data by maintaining:

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Security frameworks guide risk management
* NIST CSF is widely used across industries
* **Govern adds leadership, accountability, and strategy to security efforts**
* The six CSF functions support the full incident lifecycle
* SP 800-53 is critical for federal security systems
* Understanding these frameworks strengthens a security analyst’s foundation
