# 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## Notes by Abhishek (Ez Abyss)

## 🌐 Purpose of Security Frameworks

Security frameworks are used by organizations as a **starting point** to develop plans that mitigate:

* Risks
* Threats
* Vulnerabilities

to **sensitive data and assets**.

Many organizations around the world create and maintain frameworks that security professionals rely on to design effective security programs. These frameworks apply to:

* For‑profit organizations
* Nonprofit organizations
* Government agencies

Although **NIST** is a U.S.-based organization, its guidance is used **globally** to implement essential cybersecurity practices.

## 🏗️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is one of the most widely used and respected security frameworks.

### Key Characteristics

* Voluntary framework
* Built on standards, guidelines, and best practices
* Designed to manage cybersecurity risk
* Applicable across industries and organization sizes

📌 *The CSF helps organizations build consistent and effective security programs.*

## 🔁 The Five Core Functions of NIST CSF

The CSF is structured around **five core functions**:

1. **Identify**
2. **Protect**
3. **Detect**
4. **Respond**
5. **Recover**

These functions guide how organizations **prepare for, handle, and recover from security incidents**.

## 🧑‍💼 Workplace Example: Applying the NIST CSF

### Scenario

A high‑risk alert indicates that a workstation has been compromised.

### Step‑by‑Step Using the CSF

* **Identify**
  The compromised workstation is identified, and an unknown device is discovered.

* **Protect**
  The unknown device is blocked remotely to prevent further damage.

* **Detect**
  Security tools are used to look for additional threat actor activity and identify the device.

* **Respond**
  The incident is investigated to determine:

  * Who connected the device
  * How the threat occurred
  * What systems were affected
  * Where the attack originated

* **Recover**
  Affected files are restored, and damage to the workstation is corrected.

📌 *In this case, the incident was caused by an employee charging an infected phone through a work laptop.*

---

## 🎯 Why the NIST CSF Matters

The CSF:

* Provides clear guidance during incidents
* Helps security teams act quickly and effectively
* Reduces organizational risk
* Supports consistent incident handling

It is a **core framework** that most security professionals are expected to understand.

## 🏛️ NIST Special Publication 800‑53 (SP 800‑53)

The NIST CSF extends into federal government security through **NIST SP 800‑53**.

### What SP 800‑53 Does

* Provides a unified framework for protecting U.S. federal information systems
* Applies to government systems and private systems used by the government
* Defines security controls used to maintain the **CIA Triad**

📌 *Understanding SP 800‑53 is essential for analysts interested in federal government roles.*

---

## 🔗 How Frameworks and Controls Work Together

* **Frameworks** provide structure and guidance
* **Controls** enforce security and reduce risk
* Both work together to protect systems and data

This integration helps maintain:

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Security frameworks guide risk management
* NIST CSF is widely used across industries
* The five CSF functions support incident response and recovery
* SP 800‑53 is critical for federal security systems
* Understanding these frameworks strengthens a security analyst’s foundation
