# 🛡️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## Notes by Abhishek (Ez Abyss)

## 🌐 Overview

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks in a structured and practical way.

At the center of the CSF are **six core functions**:

> **Govern → Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover**

These functions support both **proactive** and **reactive** security measures and help organizations:

* Manage cybersecurity risk
* Implement effective security strategies
* Learn from past security incidents

Security incidents will happen. What matters is how well an organization is prepared to handle and recover from them.

---

## 🔁 Why the Core Functions Matter

The core functions:

* Guide daily security operations
* Improve incident response efficiency
* Reduce damage from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
* Strengthen overall security posture

They act as a **lifecycle**, not isolated steps.

---

## 0️⃣ Govern

### Purpose

Establish and maintain **cybersecurity governance** across the organization.

### What Governance Focuses On

* Setting clear cybersecurity objectives
* Ensuring leadership commitment and accountability
* Defining roles, responsibilities, and decision-making structures
* Developing and maintaining a comprehensive risk management strategy
* Continuously improving cybersecurity performance

### Analyst Perspective

* Follow governance policies and standards
* Support risk management and compliance efforts
* Align daily security work with organizational goals

📌 *Strong governance ensures cybersecurity is a business priority, not just a technical task.*

---

## 1️⃣ Identify

### Purpose

Manage cybersecurity risk and understand its impact on **people, systems, and assets**.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

* Monitoring systems and devices
* Identifying assets and risks
* Understanding potential security issues

### Analyst Example

* Monitoring the internal network to spot unusual activity

📌 *You cannot protect what you do not understand.*

---

## 2️⃣ Protect

### Purpose

Implement safeguards to limit or contain the impact of cybersecurity threats.

### How Protection Is Achieved

* Policies and procedures
* Employee training and awareness
* Security tools and controls

### Analyst Example

* Reviewing past incidents
* Improving policies based on historical attack data

📌 *Strong protection reduces the chance of successful attacks.*

---

## 3️⃣ Detect

### Purpose

Identify potential cybersecurity incidents **quickly and accurately**.

### Key Activities

* Monitoring systems
* Improving detection tools
* Classifying alerts (low, medium, high risk)

### Analyst Example

* Reviewing security tool configurations
* Ensuring alerts notify the security team promptly

📌 *Fast detection limits damage.*

---

## 4️⃣ Respond

### Purpose

Contain, analyze, and mitigate security incidents once detected.

### Key Activities

* Following incident response procedures
* Collecting and organizing incident data
* Identifying root causes
* Improving processes to prevent recurrence

### Analyst Example

* Helping document an incident
* Suggesting process improvements after analysis

📌 *Good response turns incidents into learning opportunities.*

---

## 5️⃣ Recover

### Purpose

Restore systems and operations to normal after an incident.

### Key Activities

* Restoring systems and data
* Fixing damaged assets
* Ensuring business continuity

### Analyst Example

* Assisting with restoring files affected by a breach

📌 *Recovery minimizes long-term impact and downtime.*

---

## 🔄 Proactive vs Reactive Security

* **Proactive:** Identify, Protect
* **Reactive:** Detect, Respond, Recover

Both are essential for effective cybersecurity strategies.

---

## 🧠 Memory Hook (Easy Recall)

**G I P D R R**
👉 *Govern → Identify → Protect → Detect → Respond → Recover*

Think of **Govern** as the leadership and decision-making layer that guides all other functions.

---

## 🧠 Memory Hook (Easy Recall)

**I Protect Detect Respond Recover**
👉 *“I Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover”*

Visualize security as a continuous loop, not a straight line.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* NIST CSF has five core functions
* Functions guide the full incident lifecycle
* Security incidents are expected, preparation is essential
* Strong recovery minimizes organizational risk
* These functions work alongside the CIA triad and other NIST frameworks
