# 🛡️ NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

## Notes By Abhishek (EzAbyss)

## 🌐 Overview

The **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** provides frameworks that help organizations manage **risks, threats, and vulnerabilities**. One of the most important frameworks for security professionals is the **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**.

Even though entry-level security analysts may not perform every step directly, **understanding RMF sets you apart** and builds a strong foundation for managing security and privacy risks.

---

## 🔁 The Seven Steps of RMF

NIST RMF consists of **seven structured steps**:

1. Prepare
2. Categorize
3. Select
4. Implement
5. Assess
6. Authorize
7. Monitor

These steps work together to help organizations reduce risk **before, during, and after** security incidents.

---

## 1️⃣ Prepare

**Prepare** focuses on activities needed to manage security and privacy risks **before a breach occurs**.

### Analyst Focus

* Monitor for potential risks
* Identify controls to reduce risk
* Support proactive security planning

📌 *This step sets the foundation for all other RMF activities.*

---

## 2️⃣ Categorize

**Categorize** involves understanding how risks affect systems and data.

### Key Considerations

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability

Security teams develop processes by evaluating how risk could impact these three areas.

### Analyst Role

* Follow organizational processes
* Help protect critical assets such as private customer information

📌 *Knowing what data is most critical helps prioritize protection efforts.*

---

## 3️⃣ Select

**Select** means choosing and documenting security controls that protect the organization.

### Common Activities

* Choosing appropriate security controls
* Customizing controls to organizational needs
* Maintaining documentation

### Example

* Keeping security **playbooks** up to date
* Managing documentation to respond to issues efficiently

📌 *Well-documented controls save time during incidents.*

---

## 4️⃣ Implement

**Implement** focuses on putting security and privacy plans into action.

### Why It Matters

Strong implementation minimizes the impact of ongoing risks.

### Example

* Identifying frequent password resets
* Improving password policies to reduce risk and workload

📌 *Good plans are only effective if properly implemented.*

---

## 5️⃣ Assess

**Assess** determines whether security controls are working as intended.

### Key Tasks

* Review implemented controls
* Analyze efficiency and effectiveness
* Identify weaknesses

During this step, analysts evaluate whether:

* Tools
* Procedures
* Controls
* Protocols

need to be updated to better manage risk.

📌 *Assessment ensures security measures actually support organizational goals.*

---

## 6️⃣ Authorize

**Authorize** means taking responsibility for existing security and privacy risks.

### Analyst Contributions

* Generate security reports
* Develop plans of action
* Set project milestones

All activities should align with **organizational security goals**.

📌 *Authorization connects technical work to leadership decisions.*

---

## 7️⃣ Monitor

**Monitor** focuses on continuously observing system performance and security.

### Daily Analyst Tasks

* Assess system operations
* Monitor controls and alerts
* Ensure systems support security goals

If systems no longer meet security requirements, changes may be needed.

📌 *Continuous monitoring keeps risk levels low over time.*

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* RMF provides a **structured approach** to managing risk
* Not all steps are hands-on for entry-level analysts, but understanding all is essential
* RMF emphasizes **proactive planning, evaluation, and continuous improvement**
* Strong RMF knowledge helps protect organizations and the people they serve
