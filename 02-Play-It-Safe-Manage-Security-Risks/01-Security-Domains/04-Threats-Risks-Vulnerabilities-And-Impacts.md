## 🌐 Assets and the Role of a Security Analyst

As an **entry-level security analyst**, one of your primary responsibilities is protecting an organization’s **digital and physical assets**.

> **Asset**: Any item that has value to an organization.

### Examples of Assets

* Physical office spaces
* Computers and devices
* Customer **PII** (Personally Identifiable Information)
* **SPII** (Sensitive PII)
* Intellectual property (patents, copyrighted data)

Organizations operate in environments full of **threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**, which constantly put these assets at risk.

## ⚠️ Threats

A **threat** is any event or circumstance that can negatively impact an asset.

### Social Engineering

* A manipulation technique that exploits **human error**
* Used to gain private information, access, or valuables

#### Phishing (Common Social Engineering Attack)

* Uses emails or messages that appear legitimate
* Contains malicious links or attachments
* Aims to steal:

  * Usernames
  * Passwords
  * Banking information

📌 *Threats represent potential danger to assets.*

## 📉 Risks

A **risk** is the likelihood that a threat will affect an asset by impacting:

* **Confidentiality**
* **Integrity**
* **Availability**

### Example of Risk

* No backup protocols in place
* Data cannot be recovered after an accident or security incident

### Risk Levels

Organizations classify assets based on risk level:

#### 🟢 Low Risk

* Publicly available information
* Minimal impact if compromised
* Examples:

  * Website content
  * Published research data

#### 🟡 Medium Risk

* Not public information
* Moderate financial or reputational impact
* Example:

  * Early release of quarterly earnings affecting stock prices

#### 🔴 High Risk

* Protected by laws and regulations
* Severe impact if compromised
* Examples:

  * PII or SPII leaks
  * Intellectual property theft

## 🧱 Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

> A **risk exists only when both a threat and a vulnerability are present**.

### Common Vulnerabilities

* Outdated firewalls, software, or applications
* Weak passwords
* Unprotected confidential data

### People as Vulnerabilities

Human actions can significantly affect security:

* Employees
* Clients
* External vendors

Security is a **shared responsibility** across the organization.

## 👥 Analyst Responsibilities in Reducing Risk

Entry-level analysts help reduce vulnerabilities by:

* Educating users to identify phishing emails
* Encouraging reporting of suspicious activity
* Monitoring and documenting access to critical assets
* Supporting physical security controls

### Examples of Good Practices

* Security awareness training
* Access cards for physical entry
* Restricting visitor access

---

## 🦠 Ransomware

**Ransomware** is a costly type of malware.

### How Ransomware Works

* Threat actors encrypt organizational data
* Systems and devices become unusable
* A ransom is demanded in exchange for a **decryption key**

> **Decryption key**: A password used to restore access to encrypted data.

Ransom negotiations and data leaks often occur through the **dark web**.

## 🌐 The Three Layers of the Web

The web consists of three interconnected layers:

### 1️⃣ Surface Web

* Accessible through standard web browsers
* Used for everyday activities like browsing and shopping

### 2️⃣ Deep Web

* Requires authorization to access
* Examples:

  * Organizational intranets
  * Employee portals

### 3️⃣ Dark Web

* Accessible only using special software
* Provides anonymity
* Commonly used by criminals to:

  * Sell stolen data
  * Conduct illegal activities

## 📊 Business Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### 1️⃣ Financial Impact

* Interrupted services and operations
* Cost of fixing security incidents
* Legal fines due to non-compliance

### 2️⃣ Identity Theft

* Sensitive data like PII can be stolen
* Data may be sold or leaked on the dark web
* Long-term harm to individuals and organizations

### 3️⃣ Reputational Damage

* Loss of customer trust
* Customers may switch to competitors
* Negative media coverage
* Possible legal penalties and fines
