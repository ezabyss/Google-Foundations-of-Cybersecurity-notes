# 🔐 Security Domains Cybersecurity Analysts Need to Know

Cybersecurity analysts can explore many areas within the field. One effective way to understand these areas is by learning about **security domains**, which are used to organize the work of security professionals.

This reading focuses on the **eight CISSP security domains** and explains how each domain connects to the daily responsibilities of a cybersecurity analyst.

---

## 1️⃣ Domain One: Security and Risk Management

All organizations must develop a strong **security posture**.

> **Security posture**: An organization’s ability to defend critical assets and data and respond to change.

### Key Elements

* Security goals and objectives
* Risk mitigation processes
* Compliance
* Business continuity plans
* Legal regulations
* Professional and organizational ethics

### Information Security (InfoSec)

InfoSec refers to processes designed to secure information. Organizations may use playbooks and training programs based on risk and business needs.

**Common InfoSec design processes:**

* Incident response
* Vulnerability management
* Application security
* Cloud security
* Infrastructure security

📌 *Example:* Updating how PII is handled to comply with the **GDPR**.

---

## 2️⃣ Domain Two: Asset Security

Asset security focuses on managing cybersecurity processes for organizational assets.

### Responsibilities

* Storage of data
* Maintenance
* Retention
* Secure destruction of physical and virtual data

Because asset loss or theft increases risk, analysts must:

* Track assets and the data they contain
* Conduct security impact analysis
* Establish recovery plans
* Manage data exposure

📌 *Example:* Creating backups to restore systems after a security incident.

---

## 3️⃣ Domain Three: Security Architecture and Engineering

This domain focuses on **managing and protecting data** through effective system design.

### Core Focus

* Implementing secure tools, systems, and processes
* Designing security into systems from the beginning

### Shared Responsibility

Shared responsibility means everyone involved plays an active role in reducing risk during system design.

### Design Principles

* Threat modeling
* Least privilege
* Defense in depth
* Fail securely
* Separation of duties
* Keep it simple
* Zero trust
* Trust but verify

📌 *Example:* Using a **SIEM tool** to monitor unusual login or user activity.

---

## 4️⃣ Domain Four: Communication and Network Security

This domain focuses on securing **physical networks and wireless communications**.

### Includes

* On-site networks
* Remote connections
* Cloud communications

### Challenges

* Managing secure access for remote and hybrid workers
* Controlling external connections

### Security Controls

* Restricted network access
* Secure remote connections

📌 *Goal:* Keep data secure when employees work or travel outside the main office.

---

## 5️⃣ Domain Five: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM ensures data security by controlling **who can access what**.

### Key Functions

* Trusting and authenticating user identities
* Authorizing access to physical and logical assets

### Principle of Least Privilege

Users are granted **only the minimum access** required to complete a task.

📌 *Example:* Allowing customer service staff to view customer phone numbers only while resolving an issue, then removing access.

---

## 6️⃣ Domain Six: Security Assessment and Testing

This domain focuses on identifying and reducing **risks, threats, and vulnerabilities**.

### Key Activities

* Security assessments
* Security control testing
* Data collection and analysis
* Security audits

Organizations may use **penetration testers (pen testers)** to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

📌 *Example:* Auditing user permissions to confirm correct access levels.

---

## 7️⃣ Domain Seven: Security Operations

Security operations focus on responding to and learning from security incidents.

### Tools and Processes

* Training and awareness
* Reporting and documentation
* Intrusion detection and prevention
* SIEM tools
* Log management
* Incident management
* Playbooks
* Post-breach forensics
* Lessons learned

Security teams work together to detect active attacks, protect sensitive data, and prevent future incidents.

📌 *Example:* Investigating large amounts of data access outside normal working hours.

---

## 8️⃣ Domain Eight: Software Development Security

This domain focuses on building **secure applications** using safe programming practices.

### Key Concept

Security must be integrated into every stage of the **software development life cycle (SDLC)**:

* Design
* Development
* Testing
* Release

### Best Practices

* Application security testing
* Secure coding standards
* Penetration testing
* Quality assurance reviews

📌 *Example:* Ensuring encryption is properly configured for medical devices storing patient data.

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* CISSP’s eight domains organize cybersecurity work
* InfoSec and least privilege are essential concepts
* Security involves people, processes, and technology
* Understanding these domains provides strong insight into cybersecurity careers
