# 🛡️ Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

CISSP Security Domains Overview

**Notes by Abhishek (EzAbyss)**

---

## 🌐 Introduction

Security professionals rely on **eight CISSP security domains** to organize responsibilities, identify gaps, and strengthen an organization’s **security posture**.

> **Security posture**: An organization’s ability to defend critical assets and data and respond effectively to change.

These domains help security teams:

* Protect sensitive data
* Reduce risks and vulnerabilities
* Maintain business continuity
* Build secure systems and networks

---

## 🔐 Domain 1: Security & Risk Management

This domain forms the **foundation of cybersecurity**.

### Key Focus Areas

* **Security goals & objectives**
  Protect critical assets such as **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**.

* **Risk mitigation**
  Implement procedures to reduce the impact of incidents like data breaches.

* **Compliance**
  Follow laws, regulations, and standards to guide internal security policies.

* **Business continuity**
  Ensure productivity continues through **disaster recovery and continuity plans**.

* **Legal & ethical responsibilities**
  Follow global laws and ethical behavior to prevent negligence, abuse, and fraud.

📌 *Why it matters:* Clear goals and strong policies reduce damage when security incidents occur.

---

## 📦 Domain 2: Asset Security

Focused on protecting **digital and physical assets** throughout their lifecycle.

### Core Responsibilities

* Secure **storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction** of data
* Protect sensitive data such as **PII and SPII**
* Ensure data security:

  * On computers
  * Over networks (internet)
  * During physical collection

### Example

* Overseeing the **destruction of hard drives** to ensure private data cannot be recovered by threat actors.

📌 *Key idea:* Know **what data exists** and **who can access it**.

---

## 🏗️ Domain 3: Security Architecture & Engineering

Focused on designing systems that are **secure by design**.

### Main Concepts

* Use secure tools, systems, and processes
* Optimize protection of organizational assets

### Shared Responsibility

> **Shared responsibility** means everyone in the organization helps maintain security.

Examples:

* Employees reporting suspicious activity
* Following security policies
* Protecting physical and virtual environments

📌 *Security works best when everyone participates.*

---

## 🌐 Domain 4: Communication & Network Security

Focused on securing **networks and communications**.

### What It Covers

* Physical networks
* Wireless communications
* Cloud-based and remote access

### Risks Addressed

* Public Wi-Fi vulnerabilities
* Insecure Bluetooth connections
* Remote work security threats

### Example

* Restricting insecure network access at the organizational level to reduce risky behavior.

📌 *Secure networks protect data wherever employees work.*

---

## 👤 Domain 5: Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Controls **who can access what** within an organization.

### Goal

Reduce risk by ensuring users only have access **necessary for their role**.

### Four Core Components

1. **Identification** – Claiming an identity (username, ID card, biometrics)
2. **Authentication** – Proving identity (password, PIN, MFA)
3. **Authorization** – Determining access level after authentication
4. **Accountability** – Logging and monitoring user actions

### Example

* Shared admin accounts prevent tracking actions during a breach.

📌 *IAM ensures accountability and limits damage during incidents.*

---

## 🧪 Domain 6: Security Assessment & Testing

Focused on evaluating how well security controls work.

### Key Activities

* Security control testing
* Data collection and analysis
* Security audits

### Purpose

* Identify vulnerabilities
* Improve existing controls
* Implement new controls

### Example

* Adding **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** after identifying weaknesses.

📌 *Continuous testing strengthens defenses.*

---

## 🚨 Domain 7: Security Operations

Focused on **detecting, responding to, and investigating incidents**.

### Responsibilities

* Incident response
* Threat mitigation
* Digital and physical forensic investigations

### Investigation Process

* Identify the incident
* Contain and neutralize the threat
* Collect evidence
* Determine **when, how, and why** it occurred

📌 *Learning from incidents helps prevent future attacks.*

---

## 💻 Domain 8: Software Development Security

Ensures applications are secure throughout development.

### Secure Coding Practices

* Guidelines for building secure software

### Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Security is integrated into every phase:

* **Design:** Secure design reviews
* **Development & Testing:** Secure code reviews
* **Deployment:** Penetration testing

📌 *Security built in early reduces long-term risk.*

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* CISSP domains provide a **structured approach** to cybersecurity
* Security is technical, organizational, and human
* Strong security posture protects data, systems, and people
