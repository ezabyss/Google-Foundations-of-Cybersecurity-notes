# 🛡️ Manage Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities


---

## 🌐 Overview

Security is about protecting **organizations and people** from **threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**. Understanding today’s threat landscape helps organizations design **policies, processes, and controls** to prevent and reduce security incidents.

As an **entry-level security analyst**, learning how to manage risk and recognize common threat actor tactics prepares you to protect both **digital and physical assets**.

---

## 📦 Assets

An **asset** is anything that has value to an organization.

### Digital Assets

* Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or national IDs
* Dates of birth
* Bank account numbers
* Mailing addresses

### Physical Assets

* Payment kiosks
* Servers
* Desktop computers
* Office spaces

Protecting these assets is a primary goal of risk management.

---

## 🔁 Risk Management Strategies

Organizations use different strategies to handle risk:

* **Acceptance** – Accepting risk to avoid disrupting business operations
* **Avoidance** – Creating plans to avoid the risk entirely
* **Transference** – Shifting risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, vendors)
* **Mitigation** – Reducing the impact or likelihood of a known risk

### Risk Management Frameworks

Organizations rely on standardized frameworks to guide risk management, including:

* **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**
* **HITRUST (Health Information Trust Alliance)**

These frameworks help protect assets from evolving threats and vulnerabilities.

---

## ⚠️ Threats

A **threat** is any event or circumstance that can negatively impact assets.

### Common Threat Types

* **Insider threats** – Employees or vendors abusing authorized access
* **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)** – Threat actors maintaining long-term unauthorized access

Security analysts defend against both **internal and external threats**.

---

## 📉 Risks

A **risk** is the likelihood that a threat will impact the **confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA)** of an asset.

> Simple idea: *Threats are possible dangers; risk is the chance they will happen.*

### Factors That Increase Risk

* **External risks** – Threat actors attempting to access private data
* **Internal risks** – Employees, vendors, or partners posing security risks
* **Legacy systems** – Outdated systems still connected to critical infrastructure
* **Multiparty risk** – Third-party vendors accessing sensitive information
* **Software compliance & licensing issues** – Missing updates or patches

---

## 🌍 Industry Risk Awareness

Security risks constantly evolve. To stay informed, organizations use:

* **NIST cybersecurity risk resources**
* **OWASP Top 10** – A regularly updated list of critical web application risks

### OWASP Updates (2017–2021)

Newly emphasized risks include:

* Insecure design
* Software and data integrity failures
* Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

📌 *Cybersecurity requires continuous learning and adaptation.*

---

## 🧱 Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

### Common Vulnerabilities

* **ProxyLogon** – Microsoft Exchange pre-authentication vulnerability
> A flaw in Microsoft exchange that lets attackers access email servers without logging in, allowing them to run malicious code remotely.
* **ZeroLogon** – Netlogon authentication protocol flaw
> A weakness in Windows authentication that lets attackers pretend to be a trusted systems and take control of servers.
* **Log4Shell** – Allows remote execution of malicious Java code
> A critical bug in a Java logging tool that allows attackers to run malicious code remotely on vulnerable systems.
* **PetitPotam** – NTLM-based authentication abuse technique
> An attack technique that tricks Windows systems into authenticating, allowing attackers to steal credentials. 
* **Security logging and monitoring failures** – Attacks go undetected
> When systems don't log or monitor activity properly, attacks can happen without anyone noticing.
* **Server-side request forgery (SSRF)** – Forces servers to access internal resources
> A vulnerability where attackers force a server to access internal systems or data that should not be exposed.
---

## 🔍 Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management involves:

* Identifying vulnerabilities
* Monitoring systems continuously
* Applying patches and updates promptly

> Even if fixes exist, unpatched systems remain vulnerable.

Early detection and remediation significantly reduce exposure to attacks.

---

## 📚 Learning Resources

To explore vulnerabilities and active threats, analysts use:

* **NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
* **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog**

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Assets can be digital or physical
* Risk management combines strategy, frameworks, and continuous monitoring
* Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities are closely connected
* Attack techniques evolve constantly
* Staying updated is critical for effective defense

Understanding these concepts prepares security analysts to **prevent, detect, and mitigate security incidents** that impact organizations and people.
