## 🎯 Role of a Security Analyst

As a **security analyst**, one of your key responsibilities is to:
- Analyze log data
- Identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- Detect suspicious or malicious activity
- Help prevent data breaches

Logs provide the **evidence** analysts need to understand what is happening inside an organization’s systems and networks.

---

## 🔍 What Is a Log?

A **log** is a record of events that occur within an organization’s:
- Systems
- Networks
- Applications
- Services

Logs capture **who did what, when, where, and how**.

Without logs, security teams have no visibility into system activity.

---

## 📁 Common Log Sources

Security analysts work with logs from many sources.  
Three of the most common and important log sources are:

- Firewall logs
- Network logs
- Server logs

---

## 🔥 Firewall Logs

### 📌 What Is a Firewall Log?
A **firewall log** is a record of:
- Incoming traffic from the internet
- Outbound traffic leaving the internal network
- Allowed and blocked connection attempts

---

### 🧾 What Firewall Logs Track
Firewall logs record:
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Ports and protocols
- Allowed or denied connections
- Suspicious traffic attempts

---

### 🎯 Why Firewall Logs Matter
Firewall logs help analysts:
- Detect unauthorized access attempts
- Identify scanning or attack behavior
- Monitor internet-facing threats

---

## 🌐 Network Logs

### 📌 What Is a Network Log?
A **network log** records activity related to devices and connections within a network.

---

### 🧾 What Network Logs Track
Network logs record:
- Devices entering and leaving the network
- Connections between devices
- Communication between services
- Network traffic patterns

---

### 🎯 Why Network Logs Matter
Network logs help analysts:
- Detect lateral movement inside a network
- Identify unusual device behavior
- Monitor internal network activity

---

## 🖥️ Server Logs

### 📌 What Is a Server Log?
A **server log** records events related to services such as:
- Websites
- Email servers
- File sharing systems
- Application servers

---

### 🧾 What Server Logs Track
Server logs record:
- Login attempts
- Username and password requests
- Access to files or services
- Errors and service failures

---

### 🎯 Why Server Logs Matter
Server logs help analysts:
- Detect compromised accounts
- Identify unauthorized access
- Investigate service abuse or breaches

---

## 👀 Why Monitoring Logs Is Critical

By monitoring logs, security teams can:
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Detect potential data breaches
- Investigate security incidents
- Understand attacker behavior

Logs are the **foundation** of security detection and response.

---

## 🧠 SIEM: Security Information and Event Management

### 📌 What Is a SIEM Tool?
A **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** tool is an application that:
- Collects log data from multiple sources
- Analyzes events for suspicious activity
- Monitors critical system activity

---

### ⚙️ What SIEM Tools Do
SIEM tools provide:
- Real-time visibility into security events
- Event monitoring and correlation
- Automated alerts for suspicious behavior
- Centralized log storage

Instead of reviewing logs one by one, analysts use SIEM tools to **see the big picture**.

---

## ⏱️ Why SIEM Tools Increase Efficiency

SIEM tools:
- Index large volumes of log data
- Reduce manual log review
- Highlight high-risk events
- Save time for security professionals

This allows analysts to focus on **investigation and response**, not raw data collection.

---

## 🛠️ SIEM Configuration and Customization

SIEM tools are **not one-size-fits-all**.

Organizations must:
- Configure SIEM rules and alerts
- Customize detection logic
- Adjust settings as new threats emerge

As threats and vulnerabilities change, SIEM tools must be **continually updated** to remain effective.

---


## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Logs record system and network events
- Firewall, network, and server logs are essential
- Logs help detect vulnerabilities and breaches
- SIEM tools collect and analyze logs
- SIEM tools improve visibility, speed, and efficiency
- Proper configuration is critical for effective detection
