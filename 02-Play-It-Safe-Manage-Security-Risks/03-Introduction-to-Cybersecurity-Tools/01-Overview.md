# 🧰 Module 2: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools

> **Goal**  
> Understand how security professionals use tools to monitor systems, detect threats, and protect organizations.

---

## 🌐 Module Overview

we learned **security frameworks, controls, and design principles**—the *theory* behind cybersecurity.

This module focuses on **practical tools** that security professionals use every day to:
- Collect security data
- Detect suspicious activity
- Investigate incidents
- Automate security tasks
- Strengthen an organization’s security posture

The module introduces **logs**, **SIEM systems**, and **SIEM dashboards**, which are foundational to modern cybersecurity operations.

## 🔧 What Are Cybersecurity Tools?

**Cybersecurity tools** are software or systems used to:
- Monitor networks, systems, and users
- Detect threats and vulnerabilities
- Analyze security events
- Respond to incidents efficiently

🔑 These tools transform raw system activity into **actionable security insights**.

---

## 📂 Logs: The Foundation of Security Monitoring

### 🔍 What Is a Log?
A **log** is a record of events that occur within a system, application, or network.

Logs act as:
- A system’s activity history
- Digital evidence for investigations
- The first line of visibility for security teams

---

### 🧾 What Do Logs Track?
Logs may record:
- Login and logout attempts
- Failed authentication attempts
- File access or deletion
- System errors
- Network connections
- Application behavior

Without logs, security teams cannot **detect**, **investigate**, or **prove** security incidents.

---

### 📁 Common Types of Logs

| Log Type | Description | Example |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Authentication logs | User login activity | Multiple failed logins |
| System logs | Operating system events | System reboot |
| Application logs | App-specific events | Application crash |
| Network logs | Network traffic | Suspicious IP connection |
| Security logs | Security alerts | Malware detection |

---

## 📊 SIEM: Security Information and Event Management

### 🧠 What Is SIEM?
**SIEM** stands for **Security Information and Event Management**.

A SIEM system:
- Collects logs from multiple sources
- Centralizes data into one platform
- Correlates related events
- Detects suspicious behavior
- Generates security alerts

Think of SIEM as the **central brain of security monitoring**.

---

### ⚙️ What Does a SIEM Do?

A SIEM helps security teams:
- 📥 Collect logs from servers, firewalls, applications, and endpoints
- 🔍 Correlate events across systems
- 🚨 Alert analysts about potential threats
- 🧪 Support incident investigation
- 📑 Assist with audits and compliance

---

### 🧩 Example Scenario

- Multiple failed login attempts
- Followed by a successful login
- Followed by data download
- From an unusual location

A SIEM correlates these events and flags them as **suspicious activity**.

---

## 📈 SIEM Dashboards

### 🖥️ What Is a SIEM Dashboard?
A **SIEM dashboard** is a visual interface that displays:
- Security alerts
- Log activity summaries
- Threat trends
- System health metrics

Dashboards help analysts quickly identify and prioritize threats.

---

### 🎯 Why Dashboards Matter
SIEM dashboards allow analysts to:
- Monitor systems in real time
- Detect anomalies faster
- Reduce response time
- Communicate risks clearly to stakeholders

---

## 🛠️ Common SIEM Tools in the Industry

| SIEM Tool | Key Strength |
|----------|-------------|
| Splunk | Advanced log search and analytics |
| IBM QRadar | Enterprise security and compliance |
| Microsoft Sentinel | Cloud-native SIEM |
| Elastic SIEM | Open-source and scalable |
| ArcSight | Large-scale security monitoring |

🔑 Entry-level analysts often work with **Splunk** or **Microsoft Sentinel**.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Logs are the foundation of cybersecurity monitoring
- Logs capture user, system, and network activity
- SIEM systems centralize and analyze logs
- SIEM dashboards visualize security data
- Security tools improve detection, response, and overall security posture
