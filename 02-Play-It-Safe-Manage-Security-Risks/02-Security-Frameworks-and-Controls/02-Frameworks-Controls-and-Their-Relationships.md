# 🛡️ Frameworks, Controls, and Their Relationships

## Notes By Abhishek (EzAbyss)

## 🌐 Overview

Organizations face many **threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**, and the requirements to protect people and systems often overlap. To manage this complexity, organizations rely on **security frameworks** and **security controls**.

* **Frameworks** provide the *structure and guidance* for security planning
* **Controls** are the *specific actions and tools* used to reduce risk

Together, they help protect **organizations, employees, and the people they serve**.

---

## 🏗️ Security Frameworks

### What Are Security Frameworks?

Security frameworks are **guidelines** used to build plans that help mitigate risks and threats to **data, privacy, and physical safety**.

Frameworks address both:

* **Digital security** (data, systems, networks)
* **Physical security** (buildings, work environments)

### Why Frameworks Matter

* Provide a starting point for security policies and processes
* Help prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents
* Support compliance with laws and regulations
* Increase employee awareness and preparedness

📌 *People are often the biggest security risk—frameworks help educate and protect them.*

---

## 👥 People and Security Awareness

Social engineering attacks (like phishing) often target employees.

Frameworks help organizations:

* Educate employees about security threats
* Teach how to recognize red flags
* Create clear reporting procedures
* Reduce the likelihood of breaches

As a security analyst, understanding and following these plans is critical to protecting people and systems.

## 🔐 Security Controls

### What Are Security Controls?

Security controls are **safeguards** designed to reduce **specific security risks**.

Without proper controls, organizations may face:

* Financial losses
* Reputational damage
* Unauthorized access
* Fraud or misuse of resources

---

## 🔑 Core Security Controls

### 1️⃣ Encryption

* Converts data from **plaintext** to **ciphertext**
* Ciphertext is unreadable without decryption
* Ensures **confidentiality** of sensitive data

📌 *Used to protect information like account details and SSNs.*

---

### 2️⃣ Authentication

* Verifies **who** someone is
* Examples:

  * Username and password
  * Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### Advanced Authentication

* **MFA**: Combines passwords with codes or biometrics
* **Biometrics**: Fingerprint, face scan, voice, or eye scan

⚠️ **Vishing** is a social engineering attack that exploits voice-based authentication.

---

### 3️⃣ Authorization

* Determines **what** a user is allowed to access
* Grants permission to specific resources

📌 *Example:* Only federal employees can access certain internal government systems.

---

## 🧠 Controls and the CIA Triad

Encryption, authentication, and authorization support the **CIA Triad**:

* **Confidentiality** – Protecting sensitive data
* **Integrity** – Ensuring data is accurate and unchanged
* **Availability** – Ensuring data is accessible when needed

---

## 🔗 Relationship Between Frameworks and Controls

* **Frameworks** define *what* needs to be protected and *why*
* **Controls** define *how* protection is achieved

Frameworks guide the selection and use of controls to reduce organizational risk.

---

## 🌍 Compliance and Regulation

Frameworks help organizations comply with laws and regulations.

### Example: HIPAA

* Healthcare organizations use frameworks to protect patient data
* Controls like **MFA** help ensure compliance

---

## 📚 Specific Security Frameworks

### 🧠 Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)

Developed by the U.S. government to provide a **common language** for describing cyber threats.

**Benefits:**

* Improves communication among security teams
* Helps analyze and share threat intelligence
* Strengthens response to evolving threats

---

### 🌐 ISO/IEC 27001

An internationally recognized framework for managing information security.

**Key Features:**

* Applies to organizations of all sizes
* Protects financial data, IP, employee data, and third-party information
* Defines requirements for an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**
* Provides a collection of controls (not mandatory but recommended)

---

## 🧰 Types of Security Controls

### Physical Controls

* Gates, fences, and locks
* Security guards
* CCTV and surveillance systems
* Access cards or badges

### Technical Controls

* Firewalls
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Antivirus software

### Administrative Controls

* Separation of duties
* Authorization policies
* Asset classification

Controls are used to **prevent, detect, or correct** security issues.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Frameworks and controls work **together** to build security
* Frameworks provide guidance; controls provide action
* Both are essential for compliance and risk reduction
* Security protects **people, data, and organizations**
* Continuous education and implementation are critical
