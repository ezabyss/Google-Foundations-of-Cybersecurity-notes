# 🔍 Plan Security Audits

**Notes by Abhishek (Ez Abyss)**

## 🌐 How Everything Works Together

Organizations use **frameworks, controls, security principles, and compliance regulations** together through a process called a **security audit**.

A **security audit** reviews an organization’s:

* Security controls
* Policies
* Procedures

and compares them against **expected standards and requirements**.

---

## 🧾 Types of Security Audits

### 🔹 External Security Audit

* Conducted by third-party organizations
* Focuses on regulatory compliance and certification

### 🔹 Internal Security Audit

* Conducted by the organization itself
* Involves compliance officers, security managers, and security teams
* Entry-level analysts often **support and contribute** to this type of audit

📌 *Internal audits help improve security posture and prevent fines due to non-compliance.*

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Internal Security Audits

Internal security audits help organizations:

* Identify organizational risks
* Assess existing security controls
* Detect compliance gaps
* Improve overall security posture
* Avoid penalties from governing agencies

---

## 🧠 Common Elements of an Internal Security Audit

Internal audits typically include five key elements:

1. Establishing scope and goals
2. Conducting a risk assessment
3. Completing a controls assessment
4. Assessing compliance
5. Communicating results to stakeholders

📌 *This note focuses on the first two elements, which are part of audit planning.*

---

## 1️⃣ Establishing Scope and Goals

### 🔎 Scope

**Scope** defines what the audit will cover.

Scope includes identifying:

* People
* Assets
* Policies
* Procedures
* Technologies

that may impact the organization’s **security posture**.

📌 *The scope sets the boundaries of the audit.*

---

### 🎯 Goals

**Goals** outline what the organization wants to achieve by conducting the audit.

Common goals include:

* Improving security posture
* Ensuring compliance with regulations
* Strengthening system controls

📌 *Goals guide decision-making throughout the audit.*

---

### 🧑‍💼 Analyst Role

Although scope and goals are usually defined by senior leaders:

* Entry-level analysts must **understand and follow** them
* Analysts use scope and goals to complete audit tasks accurately

---

### 📋 Example Scope

* Assess user permissions
* Identify existing controls, policies, and procedures
* Account for technology currently in use

### 📋 Example Goals

* Align with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
* Establish policies and procedures for compliance
* Fortify system controls

---

## 2️⃣ Conducting a Risk Assessment

### 🔍 Purpose

A **risk assessment** identifies:

* Threats
* Risks
* Vulnerabilities

that could negatively impact organizational assets.

This helps determine:

* What security measures are needed
* Which controls should be implemented or improved

---

### 🧾 Analyst Involvement

While managers often conduct the assessment:

* Analysts review assessment details
* Analysts help evaluate required controls and compliance needs

---

### 🗂️ Example Risk Assessment Findings

**Assets at Risk:**

* Employee equipment (laptops, smartphones, peripherals)
* Internal network storing customer and organizational data

**Identified Issues:**

* Inadequate asset management
* Weak physical and digital security controls
* Insufficient protection of private information

**Risk Level:**

* High (8 out of 10)

📌 *High risk indicates urgent need for stronger controls and compliance alignment.*

---

## 🧠 Remember

**Audit Planning = Scope + Goals + Risk Awareness**

If you remember these three, you understand the foundation of internal audits.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Security audits connect frameworks, controls, and compliance
* Internal audits are common for entry-level analysts
* Scope defines what is reviewed
* Goals define what the organization wants to improve
* Risk assessments identify threats and vulnerabilities early
* Strong planning leads to effective audits
