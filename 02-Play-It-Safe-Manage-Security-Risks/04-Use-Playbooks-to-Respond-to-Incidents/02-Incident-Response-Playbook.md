# 🚨 Incident Response Playbooks  
---

## 🌐 Overview

Playbooks help security professionals act with:
- Urgency
- Efficiency
- Accuracy
- Consistency

---

## 📘 What Is a Playbook?

A **playbook** is a manual that provides **predefined, up-to-date steps** for responding to an incident or operational task.

In cybersecurity, playbooks:
- Define what actions to take
- Specify which tools to use
- Clarify who is responsible for each task

Playbooks reduce confusion during high-pressure situations.

---

## 🧠 Playbook Strategy and Plan

Playbooks are accompanied by two key components:

### **Strategy**
- Outlines expectations for team members
- Defines roles and responsibilities
- May identify individuals assigned to tasks

### **Plan**
- Describes **how** each task should be completed
- Ensures actions are performed in the correct order

Together, strategy and plan ensure a coordinated response.

---

## 🔄 Playbooks as Living Documents

Playbooks are **living documents**, meaning they are:
- Continuously reviewed
- Regularly updated
- Maintained collaboratively by security teams

### Updates are made when:
- A failure or oversight is discovered
- Industry standards or regulations change
- Threat actor tactics and techniques evolve

This ensures playbooks remain effective and relevant.

---

## 🧩 Types of Playbooks

Organizations use many types of playbooks, including:
- Incident response playbooks
- Vulnerability response playbooks
- Alert-specific playbooks
- Team-specific playbooks
- Product-specific playbooks

Playbooks may address specific threats such as:
- Ransomware
- Vishing
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)

Each organization’s playbooks vary based on:
- Industry
- Country
- Legal and regulatory requirements
- Type of data involved

---

## 🏢 Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks

### 📌 Purpose
These playbooks are commonly used by **entry-level cybersecurity professionals** and are designed to guide responses to incidents and vulnerabilities.

They are developed based on an organization’s **business continuity plan**.

---

### 📘 Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A **business continuity plan** defines how an organization:
- Recovers from disruptions
- Continues operations after incidents
- Maintains critical services

Incident and vulnerability playbooks support these goals.

---

### 🧠 Why These Playbooks Matter

Both incident and vulnerability response playbooks:
- Contain predefined response steps
- Ensure compliance with laws and policies
- Minimize human error
- Enforce timely action

They are especially important during **forensic investigations**, where mishandling data can compromise evidence.

## 🔁 Phases of an Incident Response Playbook

An incident response playbook consists of **six phases**:

### **1️⃣ Preparation**
- Document procedures
- Define roles and responsibilities
- Train teams and educate users

---

### **2️⃣ Detection**
- Identify suspicious activity
- Receive alerts (often from SIEM tools)

---

### **3️⃣ Analysis**
- Confirm whether an incident occurred
- Assess scope, impact, and severity

---

### **4️⃣ Containment**
- Limit damage
- Prevent spread of the incident
- Protect critical assets

---

### **5️⃣ Eradication**
- Remove malicious artifacts
- Fix vulnerabilities

---

### **6️⃣ Recovery**
- Restore systems to a secure state
- Resume normal operations

---

### 🔁 Additional Ongoing Activities
- Post-incident analysis
- Coordination and communication throughout the response

---

## ⚠️ Risk and Urgency

The level of risk depends on the **potential damage to organizational assets**.

A simplified concept:
- Higher likelihood of threat → Higher risk

Because of this:
- Speed matters
- Accuracy matters
- Following playbooks is critical

---

## 🔗 How SIEM Tools and Playbooks Work Together

- **SIEM tools** detect and alert on threats
- **Playbooks** guide analysts on how to respond
- Together, they create a structured and efficient response process

**SIEM detects → Playbook responds**

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Playbooks provide structured response steps
- They must be regularly updated
- Incident and vulnerability playbooks are widely used
- Following playbooks ensures compliance and accuracy
- Post-incident learning improves future security
- Playbooks protect assets and support business continuity
