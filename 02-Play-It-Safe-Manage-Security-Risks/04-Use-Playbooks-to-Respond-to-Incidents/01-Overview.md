**Course 2: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools**
# 🧩 Module 4: Playbooks & Incident Response  

---

## 🌐 Module Overview

the final section of this course.

In previous modules, we explored:
- Logs and log sources
- SIEM tools and dashboards
- How SIEM tools help detect threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

In this module, we shift focus from **detection** to **response**.

---

## 🎯 What This Module Focuses On

This module introduces two critical concepts used by security professionals:

1. **Playbooks**
2. **Incident Response**

These tools and processes help security teams respond effectively when a threat is detected.

---

## 📘 What Are Playbooks?

A **playbook** is a documented guide that outlines:
- Step-by-step actions
- Roles and responsibilities
- Procedures to follow during a security event

Playbooks ensure that security teams:
- Respond consistently
- Reduce mistakes under pressure
- Act quickly during incidents

---

## 🔗 How Playbooks Work with SIEM Tools

SIEM tools:
- Detect suspicious activity
- Generate alerts
- Identify threats, risks, or vulnerabilities

Playbooks:
- Tell analysts **what to do next**
- Provide structured response steps
- Help translate alerts into action

👉 **SIEM detects → Playbook responds**

---

## 🚨 Incident Response

**Incident response** is the organized approach an organization takes to:
- Identify a security incident
- Contain the damage
- Eliminate the threat
- Recover systems and data
- Prevent future incidents

Incident response is essential for:
- Limiting impact
- Protecting assets
- Maintaining trust and operations

---

## 🔁 The Six Phases of Incident Response

In this module, you will learn about the **six phases of incident response**, which provide a structured framework for handling security incidents from start to finish.

These phases help ensure that incidents are:
- Managed systematically
- Documented properly
- Learned from and improved upon

*(The six phases will be explored in detail later in the module.)*

---

## 🧠 Why 
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- How playbooks guide security responses
- How incident response frameworks protect organizations
- How analysts move from detection to action
- How structured responses reduce risk and damage

This knowledge prepares you to think like a **real security analyst**, not just a tool user.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- SIEM tools detect security issues
- Playbooks guide how to respond
- Incident response provides a structured process
- Security is not just about detection, but action
- Consistent response improves security posture
