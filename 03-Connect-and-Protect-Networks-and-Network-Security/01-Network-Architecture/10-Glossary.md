## 📖 Glossary Terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Bandwidth** | The maximum data transmission capacity over a network, measured in bits per second (bps). |
| **Cloud Computing** | The practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices. |
| **Cloud Network** | A collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote data centers and are accessed via the internet. |
| **Data Packet** | A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network, containing addressing and payload data. |
| **Hub** | A network device that broadcasts incoming data to every device connected to it. |
| **Internet Protocol (IP)** | A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network. |
| **IP Address** | A unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet or a network. |
| **Local Area Network (LAN)** | A network that spans a small geographic area such as a home, school, or office building. |
| **MAC Address** | A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each physical device on a network, used at the data link layer. |
| **Modem** | A device that connects a router to an internet service provider (ISP) and brings internet access to the LAN. |
| **Network** | A group of connected devices that can communicate and share resources with each other. |
| **OSI Model** | A standardized seven-layer conceptual model that describes how computers communicate and send data over a network. |
| **Packet Sniffing** | The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets as they travel across a network. |
| **Port** | A software-based location on a device that organizes sending and receiving network traffic for specific services. |
| **Router** | A network device that connects multiple networks and forwards data packets based on IP addresses. |
| **Speed** | The rate at which data is sent or received over a network, measured in bits per second. |
| **Switch** | A network device that forwards data only to the intended destination device using MAC addresses. |
| **TCP/IP Model** | A four-layer framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across a network. |
| **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** | A connection-oriented protocol that establishes reliable communication and ensures data delivery. |
| **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** | A connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a connection, prioritizing speed over reliability. |
| **Wide Area Network (WAN)** | A network that spans a large geographic area such as a city, state, or country. |
