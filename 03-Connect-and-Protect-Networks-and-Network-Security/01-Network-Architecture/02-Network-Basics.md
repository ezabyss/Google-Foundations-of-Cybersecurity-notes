# 🌐 Network Basics & Security Mindset

**Notes By Abhishek (EzAbyss)**

## 🧠 What a Network Means

A **network** is a group of connected devices that can communicate with each other.

These devices don’t have to be complex:
- At home → phone, laptop, smart TV, refrigerator
- At work → computers, printers, servers
- Across locations → offices in different countries

What makes it a network is not the device —  
it’s the **connection and communication** between them.

---

## 🔗 How Devices Communicate

Devices communicate using:
- **Wired connections** (network cables)
- **Wireless connections** (Wi-Fi)

But communication only works when:
- Devices can **find each other**
- Data reaches the **correct destination**

That’s where **addresses** come in.

---

## 🆔 Device Identification on a Network

Every device on a network has **unique identifiers** so communication goes to the right place.

### 🔹 IP Address
- Logical address
- Helps devices locate each other across networks
- Can change depending on the network

### 🔹 MAC Address
- Physical address
- Assigned to the device hardware
- Usually permanent

🔐 **Security insight:**  
If an attacker spoofs or manipulates addresses, they can intercept or redirect traffic.

---

## 🏠 Local Area Network (LAN)

A **LAN** covers a small physical area:
- Home
- School
- Office building

Example:
- When my phone connects to my home Wi-Fi, it becomes part of a LAN.
- Devices inside a LAN can directly share resources.

🔐 **Security relevance:**
- Internal threats often start inside the LAN
- Misconfigured LANs expose sensitive devices

---

## 🌍 Wide Area Network (WAN)

A **WAN** covers large geographic areas:
- Cities
- Countries
- Continents

The **Internet** itself is the largest WAN.

Example:
- Employees in different countries sharing company resources
- Data traveling across multiple networks

🔐 **Security relevance:**
- Data travels over untrusted paths
- Encryption and monitoring become critical

---

## 🔁 LAN + WAN Relationship

- A **LAN connects to the WAN**
- The WAN allows LANs in different locations to communicate

This connection point is often a **major attack surface**.

---

## 🔐 Why Network Knowledge Matters for Security

Understanding networks helps answer questions like:
- Where did this traffic come from?
- Where is it going?
- Should this communication be allowed?
- Is sensitive data exposed?

Without network knowledge:
- Alerts make no sense
- Logs are just noise
- Threats go unnoticed

---

## 👩‍💻 Real-World Perspective from Industry

- Network security protects **users and infrastructure**
- Security requires collaboration between teams
- Designing safe network policies has real-world impact
- Curiosity and continuous learning are essential

Cybersecurity is not solo work —  
it’s a **team effort across engineering, security, and business**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Offensive & Defensive Security Mindset

### 🔴 Offensive Security
- Simulates attackers
- Finds weaknesses before real hackers do
- Requires deep understanding of systems and networks

### 🔵 Defensive Security
- Monitors traffic
- Configures firewalls
- Analyzes logs and alerts
- Protects data and availability

Both roles rely heavily on **network understanding**.

---

## 🛠️ Core Skills Linked to Networking

An entry-level security analyst frequently uses:

- **Command line**
  - Interact with operating systems
  - Investigate processes and network activity

- **Log parsing**
  - Understand what happened and why
  - Identify root causes of issues

- **Network traffic analysis**
  - Detect slow or misrouted traffic
  - Identify data leaks or misconfigurations
  - Check for exposed credentials

🔐 Key questions analysts ask:
- Is traffic encrypted?
- Are firewalls configured safely?
- Is sensitive data leaking?

---

## 💡 Personal Takeaways

- Networks are the backbone of modern systems
- Every security issue touches the network in some way
- Understanding communication paths = understanding risk
- Security requires both technical and communication skills
- Curiosity is a long-term advantage in cybersecurity
