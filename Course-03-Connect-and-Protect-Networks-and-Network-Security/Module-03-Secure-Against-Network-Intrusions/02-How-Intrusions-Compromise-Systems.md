# 🚨 How Intrusions Compromise Your System
**Focus:** Network interception attacks, backdoor attacks, and real-world impact  

---

## 🌐 Why Network Intrusions Matter

Every network has **inherent vulnerabilities**.

No matter how large or small an organization is, **any network can become a target**.  
Security analysts must assume that **attacks are inevitable** and focus on **detection, mitigation, and prevention**.

---

## 🎯 Why Attackers Target Networks

Attackers have **different motivations**, including:

- 💰 **Financial gain** (fraud, ransomware, data theft)
- 🧠 **Personal motives** (disgruntled employees)
- 🏴 **Political or ideological reasons** (hacktivism)
- 🕵️ **Espionage** (corporate or government spying)

> **Key idea:**  
> Attacks are not always random — many are **targeted and intentional**.

---

## 📡 Network Interception Attacks

Network interception attacks occur when an attacker **captures, inspects, or alters data in transit**.

### 🔍 Packet Sniffing
- Uses software or hardware tools to capture network traffic
- Allows attackers to **read sensitive data**
- Can expose credentials, personal data, or financial information

> Packet sniffing is especially dangerous on **unencrypted networks**.

---

### ✏️ Traffic Manipulation
Attackers may not only **observe** traffic, but also **modify it**.

Examples:
- Altering messages
- Injecting malicious code
- Redirecting transactions

📌 **Real-world example:**  
Intercepting a bank transfer and changing the destination account to one controlled by the attacker.

### 🔁 Related Interception Attacks
You’ll learn later in the course:
- **On-path (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks**
- **Replay attacks**

---

## 🚪 Backdoor Attacks

A **backdoor** is a method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls.

### 🧱 Real-World Analogy
A secure building may have:
- Cameras
- Access cards
- Guards

But a **poorly monitored back entrance** can bypass all of them.

---

### 🧑‍💻 Backdoors in Cybersecurity

Backdoors can be:
- **Intentionally created** by developers for troubleshooting
- **Installed by attackers** after a system is compromised

Once a backdoor exists, attackers can maintain **persistent access**.

---

### 💥 What Attackers Can Do with a Backdoor

- Install malware
- Steal confidential information
- Launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Change security settings
- Enable future attacks

> A backdoor turns a **temporary breach into a long-term threat**.

---

## 🌊 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

A **DoS attack** floods a system or network with traffic until it becomes unavailable.

Effects:
- Systems go offline
- Legitimate users are blocked
- Business operations stop

---

## 📉 Impact of Network Intrusions

Network intrusions can affect organizations in **three critical areas**.

---

### 💰 Financial Impact
- Lost revenue due to downtime
- Infrastructure repair costs
- Ransom payments
- Legal fines and lawsuits

> Large organizations can lose **millions of dollars per hour** during outages.

---

### 🏷️ Reputational Impact
- Loss of customer trust
- Damage to brand credibility
- Customers choosing competitors

Trust, once lost, is **extremely difficult to regain**.

---

### 🛑 Public Safety Impact
Especially critical for:
- Government networks
- Power grids
- Water systems
- Defense and emergency communications

A successful attack could cause **physical harm**, not just digital damage.

---

## 🛡️ Analyst Perspective

A security analyst must constantly ask:

- What data is traveling across the network?
- Is it encrypted?
- Could this traffic be intercepted or altered?
- Are there unknown access paths (backdoors)?
- How quickly could this attack spread?

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Attackers constantly search for vulnerabilities
- Network interception and backdoor attacks are common
- Intrusions can cause financial, reputational, and public harm
- Continuous education and vigilance are essential

---

## 🎯 Summary

> “Network intrusions compromise systems by intercepting or bypassing normal security controls.  
> Interception attacks target data in transit, while backdoor attacks enable persistent access.  
> These intrusions can cause severe financial loss, reputational damage, and public safety risks.”

---

## 🧠 Memory Anchors

- **Interception = watching or changing data**
- **Backdoor = bypassing security**
- **DoS = overwhelming availability**
- **Security = prevention + detection + response**
