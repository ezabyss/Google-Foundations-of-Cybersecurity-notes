## 🎯 Why Cloud Network Hardening Matters

In recent years, organizations increasingly rely on **cloud-based network services**.

> As a security analyst, you must secure **both on-premises networks and cloud networks**.

Cloud environments introduce **new risks, shared responsibilities, and unique hardening practices**.

---

## 🧠 What Is a Cloud Network?

### 📌 Definition

A **cloud network** is a collection of:

* Servers or computers
* Storage resources
* Applications and data

These resources are:

* Hosted in **remote data centers**
* Accessed via the **internet**
* Provided through **cloud computing services**

---

## ⚙️ What Cloud Computing Provides

Cloud networks enable organizations to use:

* On-demand storage
* Processing power
* Data analytics
* Scalable applications

> Cloud services allow flexibility, but they still require strong security controls.

---

## 🔐 Why Cloud Servers Still Need Hardening

Although cloud servers are hosted by **cloud service providers (CSPs)**:

* CSPs **cannot prevent all intrusions**
* Attacks can come from:

  * External malicious actors
  * Internal threats

👉 **Security is a shared responsibility**, not fully handled by the provider.

---

## 🧩 Shared Responsibility Model (Key Concept)

* Cloud providers secure the **cloud infrastructure**
* Organizations secure:

  * Their data
  * Applications
  * User access
  * Configurations

> Misconfigurations are a leading cause of cloud breaches.

---

## 🖼️ Server Baseline Images in the Cloud

### 📌 What Is a Baseline Image?

A **server baseline image** is a standardized, approved configuration used to create cloud servers.

---

### 🔍 Why Baseline Images Matter

* All cloud server instances are compared against the baseline
* Helps detect:

  * Unverified changes
  * Misconfigurations
  * Possible intrusions

> Any deviation from the baseline may indicate a security issue.

---

## 🧱 Cloud Hardening Through Separation

Similar to OS hardening, cloud environments use **separation** to improve security.

### Examples of Separation:

* Older applications separated from newer ones
* Internal systems separated from public-facing applications
* Different service categories isolated from each other

🔐 This limits the **blast radius** if one component is compromised.

---

## 🛡️ Cloud Network Hardening Practices

Organizations must still secure:

* Network access controls
* Authentication and authorization
* Data storage and communication
* Application deployment

> Cloud operations must be hardened just like traditional networks.

---

## 🧠 Key Differences: Cloud vs Traditional Network Hardening

| Traditional Networks   | Cloud Networks               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Physical servers       | Virtual servers              |
| Manual configuration   | Baseline images & automation |
| Local monitoring       | Centralized cloud logging    |
| On-prem responsibility | Shared responsibility model  |

---

## 🧠 Summary

* Cloud networks store data and apps remotely
* CSPs do not stop all intrusions
* Baseline images detect unauthorized changes
* Separation reduces impact of attacks
* Organizations are still responsible for cloud security

---

## 📝 Key Line

> *Cloud network hardening secures cloud-based servers, data, and applications by enforcing baseline configurations, isolating services, monitoring for unauthorized changes, and applying shared responsibility security practices to reduce intrusion risk.*
