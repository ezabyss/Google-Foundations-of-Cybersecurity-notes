## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how the Bash shell processes user input and returns output or error messages. By using simple commands such as `echo`, I observed how the shell displays text exactly as it is provided, which is useful for communicating messages, debugging scripts, and confirming command behavior.

Using the `expr` command reinforced how the shell performs basic integer arithmetic and how strict syntax rules, such as spacing between operands and operators, affect command execution. This highlighted the importance of accuracy when entering commands in a shell environment.

The `clear` command demonstrated how to manage the shell workspace by removing clutter and allowing focus on current tasks. Overall, this lab strengthened my foundational skills in interacting with the Linux operating system through the shell, which is essential for security analysts when running commands, interpreting results, and troubleshooting issues.
