## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how Linux authorization is enforced through file and directory permissions. By examining permission settings with `ls -l` and `ls -la`, I learned how to identify which users and groups have access to specific resources.

Using the `chmod` command to remove unauthorized write and execute permissions reinforced the importance of applying the principle of least privilege. Restricting access to sensitive files and directories demonstrated how improper permissions can create security risks if not carefully managed.

Managing permissions on hidden files and directories further strengthened my understanding of how security analysts protect system data from unintended modification or access. Overall, this lab improved my confidence in configuring and auditing Linux permissions to maintain a secure environment.
