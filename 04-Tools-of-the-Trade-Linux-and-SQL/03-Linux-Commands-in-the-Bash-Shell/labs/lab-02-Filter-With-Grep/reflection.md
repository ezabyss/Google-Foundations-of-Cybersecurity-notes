## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how to efficiently search and filter information in Linux using the `grep` command and piping.
By working with server log files and user reports, I practiced extracting only the relevant data instead of manually scanning large amounts of text.

Using `grep` to isolate error messages from log files demonstrated how security analysts quickly identify issues during monitoring and investigations. Filtering filenames with `ls | grep` reinforced how piping allows commands to work together to narrow down results efficiently.

Searching within files for specific usernames and departments showed how text filtering supports auditing and user activity analysis. Overall, this lab strengthened my ability to locate critical information quickly, which is an essential skill for log analysis, incident response, and security operations.
