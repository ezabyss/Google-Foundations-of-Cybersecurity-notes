## Reflection

This lab helped me strengthen my understanding of navigating the Linux file system using the Bash shell. By practicing commands such as `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`, I became more comfortable identifying my location in the system and moving between directories efficiently.

Reading file contents using `cat` and inspecting log data with `head` demonstrated how security analysts analyze reports and logs directly from the command line, especially in environments without a graphical interface. This is particularly important during incident response and system investigations.

Overall, this lab reinforced the importance of precision and context when working in a Linux environment, as running commands in the correct directory is critical for accurate analysis and system security.
