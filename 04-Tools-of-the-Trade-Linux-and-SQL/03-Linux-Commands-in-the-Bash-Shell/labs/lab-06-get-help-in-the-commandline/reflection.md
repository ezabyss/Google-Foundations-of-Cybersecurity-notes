## Reflection

This lab reinforced the importance of knowing how to find help directly from the Linux command line instead of relying on memorization. As a security analyst, it is unrealistic to remember every command and option, but it is essential to know where and how to look up accurate information quickly.

Using the `whatis` command showed how to get a fast, high-level description of what a command does, which is useful when reviewing unfamiliar tools. The `man` command provided detailed documentation and helped me identify specific options, such as determining how to number output lines or set an expiration date for a user account.

The `apropos` command was especially useful for discovering commands based on keywords when the exact command name was unknown. This demonstrated how analysts can efficiently identify the correct tools to perform a task even in unfamiliar environments.

Overall, this lab strengthened my confidence in navigating Linux documentation and highlighted that effective use of help resources is a critical skill for working efficiently and securely in real-world systems.
