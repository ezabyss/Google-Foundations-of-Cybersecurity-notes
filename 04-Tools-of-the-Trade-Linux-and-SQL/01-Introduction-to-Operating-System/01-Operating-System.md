# 🖥️ Operating Systems Basics & Comparison

---

## 🎯 Why Operating Systems Matter in Security

Every device—**computers, smartphones, tablets**—runs on an **operating system (OS)**.

As a **security analyst**, you don’t just protect data—you protect the **operating systems** that control:

* Hardware
* Applications
* User access

> **If the OS is insecure, the entire system is at risk.**

---

## 🧠 What Is an Operating System?

### 📌 Definition

An **operating system (OS)** is the **interface between computer hardware and the user**.

The OS:

* Makes the computer run efficiently
* Allows users to interact with hardware
* Manages programs, memory, and devices

---

## 🧱 Hardware vs Software

* **Hardware** → Physical components (CPU, keyboard, mouse, printer)
* **Software** → Programs and applications

🧠 The OS connects **hardware** and **software**, making both usable.

---

## ⏳ Evolution of Operating Systems (Quick History)

### Early Computers (1950s)

* Could run **only one program at a time**
* Required restarting the computer for each task

➡️ Extremely time-consuming and inefficient

### Modern Operating Systems

* Run **multiple programs simultaneously**
* Access external devices easily
* Optimize performance automatically

> Thanks to OS evolution, simple tasks like sending an email are instant.

---

## 🤝 How OS Helps Humans & Computers Communicate

* Computers understand **binary (0s and 1s)**
* Humans use **commands, clicks, and text**

🔐 The OS bridges this communication gap, allowing complex interaction.

---

## 🔐 Why OS Security Is Critical

Operating system security includes:

* Securing files and data
* Managing user authentication
* Controlling access permissions

These protections help prevent:

* Viruses
* Worms
* Malware

---

## 🧑‍💻 OS Tasks Performed by Security Analysts

A security analyst may:

* Manage user access and permissions
* Configure and maintain firewalls
* Set security policies
* Enable antivirus protection
* Perform auditing, accounting, and logging

🧠 **All of these require a strong understanding of operating systems.**

## 🖥️ Common Operating Systems (Security-Relevant)

### 1️⃣ Windows

* Introduced: **1985**
* Closed-source OS
* Widely used in personal and enterprise systems

---

### 2️⃣ macOS

* Introduced: **1984**
* Partially open source (kernel is open source)
* Used on Apple computers

---

### 3️⃣ Linux

* Introduced: **1991**
* Fully open source
* Highly important in cybersecurity
* Many security-focused distributions

> Linux is heavily used in servers, cloud, and security tools.

---

### 4️⃣ ChromeOS

* Introduced: **2011**
* Partially open source
* Common in education environments

---

### 5️⃣ Android

* Introduced: **2008**
* Open source
* Used on mobile devices

---

### 6️⃣ iOS

* Introduced: **2007**
* Partially open source
* Used on Apple mobile devices

---

## ⚠️ Operating Systems & Vulnerabilities

### Key Reality

> **All operating systems have vulnerabilities.**

Keeping systems secure requires:

* Regular updates
* Security patches
* Awareness of known risks

---

## 🕰️ Legacy Operating Systems

### 📌 Definition

A **legacy operating system** is an **outdated OS that is still in use**.

---

### ⚠️ Why Legacy OS Are Risky

* No longer supported
* No security updates
* Vulnerable to new attacks

Legacy systems are common when:

* Old software is incompatible with new OS versions
* Embedded systems are involved

---

## 📚 OS Vulnerability Resources (Important)

Security analysts track vulnerabilities using trusted sources:

* **Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)**
* **Apple Security Updates**
* **CVE Reports for Linux (e.g., Ubuntu)**
* **Google Cloud Security Bulletin**

🧠 Knowing where to look is just as important as knowing the vulnerability.

---

## 🧠 Summary

* OS connects users and hardware
* OS security protects the entire system
* Windows, macOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, and iOS are widely used
* Linux is especially important in security
* Legacy operating systems are high-risk
* Staying updated reduces vulnerabilities

---

## 📝 One-Line

> *Operating systems manage hardware, software, and user interaction, and securing them through updates, access controls, and awareness of vulnerabilities is essential to protecting organizational systems.*

---

✨ *Master operating systems, and you strengthen every layer of security.*
