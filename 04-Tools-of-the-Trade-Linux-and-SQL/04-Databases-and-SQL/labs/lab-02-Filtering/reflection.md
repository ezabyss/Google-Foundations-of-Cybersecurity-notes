## Reflection

This lab strengthened my understanding of how SQL filters can be used to retrieve specific information efficiently from a database. By applying the `WHERE` clause, I was able to narrow query results to only the records that were relevant to the task, which is essential when working with large datasets in a security context.

Filtering machines by operating system demonstrated how SQL can be used to identify assets that require updates or remediation. This is a common task in security operations when maintaining system compliance and reducing vulnerabilities.

Retrieving employees by department highlighted how filtering supports operational tasks such as distributing security notices or enforcing department-specific policies. Using the `LIKE` operator to identify employees in a specific building further showed how pattern matching can help investigate localized issues, such as hardware or security incidents.

Overall, this lab emphasized the importance of precision in SQL queries and reinforced how filtering techniques are critical for effective data analysis and security investigations.
