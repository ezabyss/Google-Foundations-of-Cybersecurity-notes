## Reflection

This lab helped me build a foundation in using SQL to retrieve and analyze data from a relational database. By working with the `organization` database, I practiced querying real-world style tables that store device and authentication information, which is highly relevant to security operations.

Using `SELECT` and `FROM` reinforced how to extract only the data needed for a specific task, such as identifying employee devices that require updates. Selecting specific columns instead of entire tables demonstrated how focused queries improve efficiency and readability.

Analyzing login activity using the `log_in_attempts` table highlighted how SQL can be used to investigate authentication behavior and detect potential anomalies. Applying the `ORDER BY` keyword to sort results by date and time made it easier to identify patterns and unusual activity.

Overall, this lab strengthened my confidence in using SQL as a tool for security analysis and showed how even basic queries form the foundation for more advanced investigations and filtering techniques.
