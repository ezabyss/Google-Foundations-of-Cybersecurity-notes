## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how Linux package management works using the
Advanced Package Tool (APT). 
I learned how APT simplifies software installation
by automatically resolving dependencies and managing package versions.

Installing and managing tools such as Suricata and tcpdump gave me hands-on
experience with applications commonly used in cybersecurity and network
monitoring environments.

The lab reinforced best practices such as updating package repositories before
installation, verifying installed packages, and safely removing software when
it is no longer needed.
