## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how logical operators can be used to create more precise and effective SQL queries. By combining multiple conditions with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators, I was able to filter large datasets down to only the records that were relevant to the investigation.

Analyzing failed login attempts after business hours demonstrated how SQL can be used to identify potentially suspicious authentication behavior. Filtering login attempts by specific dates and excluding those originating from certain locations further reinforced how targeted queries support security investigations.

Using logical operators to retrieve employee information based on department and office location highlighted how SQL supports operational tasks such as system updates and security notifications. The use of the `LIKE` operator alongside `AND` conditions showed how pattern matching can be combined with logical filters for more advanced querying.

Overall, this lab strengthened my confidence in writing complex SQL filters and emphasized how precise data retrieval is essential for efficient and accurate security analysis.
