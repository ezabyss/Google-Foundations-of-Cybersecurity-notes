## Reflection

This lab helped me develop practical experience in managing files and directories using Linux Bash commands. By creating and removing directories, moving and deleting files, and organizing the directory structure, I reinforced how important proper file management is for maintaining a secure and efficient system.

Using commands such as `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `mv`, `rm`, and `touch` demonstrated how security analysts manage data lifecycle tasks and keep systems organized. Editing a file with the `nano` text editor highlighted the importance of documenting changes and maintaining clear records of completed tasks.

Overall, this lab strengthened my confidence in performing core file management operations in Linux, which are essential skills for system administration, security operations, and incident response workflows.
