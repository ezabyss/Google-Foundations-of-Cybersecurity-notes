# Lab 06: Get Help in the Command Line

---

## Activity Overview

This lab focuses on learning how to get help directly from the Linux command line. As a security analyst, it is not expected to memorize every command or option. Instead, knowing how to quickly find accurate information is a critical skill.

In this lab, built-in Linux documentation tools such as `man`, `whatis`, and `apropos` are used to understand command functionality, explore available options, and identify the correct command to perform a specific task.

---

## Scenario

You need to gather information about Linux commands and determine which commands to use for specific tasks.

During this lab, you will:

- Get short descriptions of commands
- View full manual pages for commands
- Search for commands using keywords
- Identify the correct command for a given task

These skills help security analysts work efficiently and confidently in unfamiliar environments.
