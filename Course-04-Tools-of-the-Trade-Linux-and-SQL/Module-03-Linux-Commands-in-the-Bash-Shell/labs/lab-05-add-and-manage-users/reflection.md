## Reflection

This lab helped me understand how authentication and user management are handled in Linux systems. By using commands such as `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`, and `chown`, I learned how security analysts control who can access a system and what resources they are authorized to use.

Verifying user details with the `id` command before deleting the account reinforced the importance of auditing and validation in security operations. Checking group memberships before removal helps prevent accidental misconfiguration or deletion of the wrong user.

Managing both primary and secondary group memberships demonstrated how Linux supports role-based access control, allowing users to work across departments while maintaining proper permissions.

Overall, this lab strengthened my confidence in managing user lifecycles securely and highlighted how careful user administration plays a critical role in maintaining system security.
